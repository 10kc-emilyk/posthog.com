PostHog Tracks is a curated set of resources for entrepreneurs and founders who are building new companies. We build in the open, so we're happy to share all the details of how we've structured PostHog, and the lessons we've learned on the way. If there's something that isn't covered here, you can even [ask us directly](/questions) for more info (or subscribe to our newsletter).
