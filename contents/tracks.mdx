Tracks is a curated reading list for founders building product-led companies like PostHog. We build in the open, so we're happy to share all the details of how we've got this far, and the lessons we learned on the way.</h3>

<h3 className="mb-0">How to <span style='color: #f64e00;'>build a team</span></h3>

It all starts with getting the right people on your project. You can check the handbook for more information about our [small team structure](/handbook/company/small-teams) and [minimal approach to management](/handbook/company/management), or head to [our staff profiles](/team) to understand what our team looks like now.

<h3 className="mb-0">How to <span className="text-red">create good processes</span></h3>

We bias heavily for tools which enable us to work collaboratively, and transparently. Some of the tools we use, like GitHub as a CMS, may sound intimidating to non-engineers, but [our experience](/blog/a-non-coders-thoughts-on-everybody-codes-culture) is that if you give teams the right support then it isn’t an issue. It helps to have [a really good employee handbook](/handbook).

<h3 className="mb-0">How to <span className="text-red">build new products</span></h3>

At PostHog, we build weirdly fast. Some of that is because we’ve assembled an amazing team — but it’s _also_ because we talk to our users and treat every new feature like its own product. It took us [a few pivots](/blog/story-about-pivots), but we got to product market fit eventually!

<h3 className="mb-0">How to <span className="text-red">sell your product</span></h3>

PostHog doesn’t have a sales team, but we’ve still learned a lot about how to sell a product and the importance of pricing. And while we don’t have a sales team, we _do_ have both a customer success and a marketing team who play a vital role in bringing in new users!
