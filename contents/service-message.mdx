<details>
  <summary>What did you do during the maintenance?</summary>
  <p>
      We're upgraded the Postgres database for our US cloud, moving from Aurora 11 to Aurora 15. This will make PostHog faster, and much more scalable. There's <a href="https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-cloud-infra/issues/1987">a public GitHub issue</a> if you'd like to follow the technical discussion.
  </p>
  </details>

<details>
<summary>What was the impact on users?</summary>
  <p>
    This work only impacted users on our US Cloud, regardless of where the teams were physically located. Self-hosted, hobby, and EU Cloud users were unaffected. We notified all users impacted by the maintenance over a week in advance, via email.
</p>
<p>
    No new data was ingested while the maintenance was underway. Instead, we queued data and began ingestion once the work was finished. Feature flags and experiments continued to function as expected for your users, but flags set to persist across authentication steps did not persist for new users who are identified during the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
    We also ran into some unanticipated issues during the upgrade, which may have meant you were unable to access your instance temporarily. Sorry about that!
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long will it take to ingest queued events?</summary>
  <p>
    We're currently ingesting all queued events and anticipate it will take less than 24 hours to recover from the lag. You can continue to use PostHog as normal during this time. 
</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I stay updated on future maintenance, or report issues?</summary>
  <p>
    We don't have any further maintenance planned, but we update this page whenever that changes.
