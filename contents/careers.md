## A bit about us

PostHog provides open-source, developer-friendly product analytics.

We had the most succesful b2b software HackerNews launch since 2012, we've got over 2K stars on our repo right now, hundreds of users and deployments at large companies.

This is a super exciting time to be joining PostHog. We're growing like crazy and we need your help.

## Our culture

In reality, as one of our first hires you'll have a large hand in shaping this, but some keywords:

* Remote first
* "Write things down"
* Prefer making things transparent and public
* No need for crazy hours. Work hard when you're working.

## Our backers

We're young, but we're already [backed](/handbook/investors) by many of the best investors in the world. This includes YCombinator, Solomon Hykes (ex-founder/CEO Docker), David Cramer (Founder/CEO Sentry), Adam Goldstein (Founder Hipmunk). See [the rest](/handbook/investors)!

# Open roles

## UX (design focussed)

###Â Objectives

PostHog is focussed on growth. The quality of our design is a key signal as to the quality of our product when developers are evaluating its potential use, thus greatly influences this.

We are looking for someone who can take ownership of this area.

The starting point would be working with the team and a brand designer to take a rebrand from idea and implementing it onto our website and docs.

The next step, would be to ensure consistency with the product itself. Ongoingly, we would like graphic design work around our blog posts, newsletter and internal pages. We also constantly are building new features and input on their design would be very valuable.

Sidenote: adorable hedgehogs, cool dev focussed stuff. What's not to like?

We're open for ideas here - either you are more a designer than a UX person and the objective is to produce .ai or Figma files for the UX that we can then convert, or if you're happy using React and can write the components yourself, event better (although not necessary). Tell us how you'd approach it.

Another major positive although not a must have is if you've worked with technical documentation before.

### Hiring process

* Please send us links to some of your previous work and a cover letter
* You'll meet our CEO James over Zoom
* You'll meet our CTO Tim over Zoom
* We'll pay you normal contracting rates for anywhere between 1-5 days to do some work with us. That'll give you a chance to learn how we'd work with you, and for us to see how you work.
* We make a decision with you.

### How to apply

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [james@posthog.com](mailto:james@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What makes you a great designer or UX person
* A few links or examples of previous design work
* What you like/dislike about PostHog
* How you found us

## Full stack engineer

### Your role

As an early engineer (we currently have a team of 5 in total), you'll be key to building a lot of the core functionality of PostHog. We encourage you to take a look at our repo (issues and PRs) to see the types of things you'd be doing.

We're looking for people who are *proactive* and are *ridiculously quick* at getting new features out, while writing test and generally maintaining a clean codebase.

### Hiring process

* You'll have a 30 minute phone-call with our CTO Tim
* You'll meet our CEO James
* Quick chat with one of the team members
* We'll pay you normal contracting rates for 3 days to do some work on PostHog. This will give you a chance to learn how we'd work with you, and for us to see how you work. You'll also end up with some open-source contributions.
* We make a decision with you.

### How to apply

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [tim@posthog.com](mailto:tim@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What you like/dislike about PostHog

## Content writer (technical)

### Objectives

PostHog is focussed on growth. Creating top quality documentation helps improve accessibility for engineers with different experience levels, and is an important signal as to the quality of the product itself.

We've also had great success with using technically-oriented blog posts to generate interest in the company. 

### What we're looking for

Are you a developer/ex-developer who has found a love of writing?

It's a pre-requisite that you have experience in producing engaging technical content, with an software engineering audience in mind.

The tone we are looking for is detail oriented, friendly and concise.

### How to apply

Email a short but thoughtful cover letter to [james@posthog.com](mailto:james@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* Why you'd be a great fit for us
* Examples of content you have produced before
* Details of your technical experience (some is important, but it doesn't have to be a huge amount)

## Growth engineer

### Objective

PostHog is focussed on growth. We want to find an engineer who can help us achieve exactly that - it's up to you to work out how to do this with us. It could mean building "team" type functionality, creating our payment flow, or it could mean creating a swag deployment system!

We are huge advocates of product-led growth. We already have a lot of organic growth, demonstrating a good level of product market fit, but we are looking for someone to take us to the next level.

### What we're looking for

Table stakes is that you are a developer who can rapidly execute tactics to enable PostHog to grow as quickly as possible. 

A great candidate loves taking initiative and is very happy thinking of and doing non scalable stuff to optimize for spee of learning.

You need to have great ideas *and* the ability to execute our '[AARRR](https://medium.com/@ms.mbalke/aarrr-framework-metrics-that-let-your-startup-sound-like-a-pirate-ship-e91d4082994b)':

* Revenue

The role will be very demanding with a lot of autonomy. We are here to support you fully in this and we embrace an experimentation mindset.
