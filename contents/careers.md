## A Bit About Us

PostHog provides open-source, developer-friendly product analytics.

We had the most succesful b2b software HackerNews launch since 2012, we've got over 2.4K stars on our repo right now, thousands of users and deployments at large companies.

This is a super exciting time to be joining PostHog. We're growing like crazy and we need your help.

We are _fully-remote_, and actively are seeking a diverse and multinational team.

## Our Culture

In reality, as one of our first hires you'll have a large hand in shaping this, but some keywords:

* Remote first
* Strong written communication -- most of our communication happens over GitHub 
* Prefer making things transparent and public
* No need for crazy hours. Work hard when you're working.

## Our Backers

We're young, but we're already [backed](/handbook/strategy/investors) by many of the best investors in the world and have millions of dollars in funding.

This includes YCombinator, Solomon Hykes (ex-founder/CEO Docker), David Cramer (Founder/CEO Sentry), Adam Goldstein (Founder Hipmunk). See [the rest](/handbook/strategy/investors)!

# Open Roles

## Fullstack Engineer

### Your Role

As an early engineer (we currently have a team of 5 in total), you'll be key to building a lot of the core functionality of PostHog. We encourage you to take a look at our repo (issues and PRs) to see the types of things you'd be doing.

We're looking for people who are *proactive* and are *ridiculously quick* at getting new features out, while writing test and generally maintaining a clean codebase.

### Hiring Process

* You'll have a 30 minute phone-call with our CTO Tim
* You'll meet our CEO James
* Quick chat with one of the team members
* We'll pay you normal contracting rates for 3 days to do some work on PostHog. This will give you a chance to learn how we'd work with you, and for us to see how you work. You'll also end up with some open-source contributions.
* We make a decision with you.

### How to Apply

Email a thoughtful cover letter to [tim@posthog.com](mailto:tim@posthog.com). A good cover letter includes:

* What makes you a great early engineer
* Relevant experience/projects you've done (including links if possible)
* Links to your GitHub / LinkedIn / resume (optional)
* What you like/dislike about PostHog
* How you found us

## Growth Engineer

### Objective

PostHog is focussed on growth. We want to find an engineer who can help us achieve exactly that - it's up to you to work out how to do this with us. It could mean building "team" type functionality, creating our payment flow, or it could mean creating a swag deployment system!

We are huge advocates of product-led growth. We already have a lot of organic growth, demonstrating a good level of product market fit, but we are looking for someone to take us to the next level.

### What We're Looking For

Table stakes is that you are a developer who can rapidly execute tactics to enable PostHog to grow as quickly as possible. 

A great candidate loves taking initiative and is very happy thinking of and doing non scalable stuff to optimize for spee of learning.

You need to have great ideas *and* the ability to execute our '[AARRR](https://medium.com/@ms.mbalke/aarrr-framework-metrics-that-let-your-startup-sound-like-a-pirate-ship-e91d4082994b)':

* Revenue

The role will be very demanding with a lot of autonomy. We are here to support you fully in this and we embrace an experimentation mindset.

* Why you'd be a great fit for us
* A couple of ideas on how you'd approach growth for us
