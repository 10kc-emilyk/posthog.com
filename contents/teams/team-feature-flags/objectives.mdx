As always, reliability is the #1 unwritten goal: Making sure feature flags are reliable trumps every other objective.

### Objective: Make sure feature flags can handle 10x current scale

In the beginning of 2024, we hit some scaling limits on flags: It's now very expensive to run flags on Django and we'll hit some scaling limits at 5x our scale.

To get ahead of this problem, we'll rewrite our flags service to be more performant and reliable. This is a continuation of last quarter's goal, since we aren't done yet.
