The best analogy I can think of for getting to product market fit is playing a game of [snakes and ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders). You can fail in multiple places and need to drop back a step, or even pivot completely. It's pretty damn unlikely it'll take you in a straight line.

The _only_ objective that matters _before_ you have product market fit, is _getting_ product market fit. Hence this guide.

This guide is based on what we learned at PostHog going first through 5 or 6 pivots, then growing zero to $MM in revenue, and 20K+ customers who are focused on achieving this or scaling afterwards. It also incorporates what we've seen from ~50 [YCombinator](https://ycombinator.com/) startups that we've had calls with to consult them on this topic!

# The Product Market Fit Game

Simply, you need to complete the title of each level as your goal. There are multiple failure modes for each level, these have been listed - go through them sequentially. Sometimes, you will find that you cannot complete a level and need to pivot your entire company - that's what you may need to do to win. 

## Level 0 - Choosing a problem to work on

Start by solving a problem you've had yourself. It needs to be a problem, that you've _actually tried to solve_. Otherwise it can't be a significant problem.

The type of idea, _and_ thus the types of users you are targeting, will greatly influence your life. I recommend that instead of going on an existential and unproductive search as to your hypothetical inner motivation, you try a bunch of ideas _and then_ figure out what you like and why. The ones you'll enjoy are probably those that you want to build in the first place, for users you want to work with. Early on in PostHog's life, we worked on a tool for sales leaders. We quickly got frustrated at generally-extroverted people being positive on calls but then not following through with what they said they'd do. We concluded we wanted to work with customer support or engineers as a result - two groups we felt would be more reliable to work with, although with their own downsides.

If you work on a problem that others tackle, you are likely to find it easier to validate the problem, but your solution must be very different - if you want to build a venture scale business, then in the long run, your solution must be 10x better or 10x cheaper for significant numbers of people to use and/or pay for it. In the short run you can make money selling a directly competitive, undifferentiated product whilst you start to differentiate, as long as you aren't dealing with buyers that need to be conservative on this decision. You could probably get someone to use a new phone company, but you won't get an enterprise to use an uproven CRM. A rip and replace strategy is harder to execute with less differentiation then selling a product to someone who hasn't got anything in place at all. Markets' willingness to try a new product will vary wildly.

If you work on a problem no one has tackled, then you must be more careful with problem validation - as it's much less likely the problem you're interested in, is one that others have.

Be especially wary about building what's trendy - it may be much easier to beat unsexy, badly run, non-innovative companies than software companies with VC funding _and_ using the latest technology for the sake of it puts you in the "solution seeking problem" failure mode. Do not be fooled about news articles covering huge fundraises by startups working in these areas - fundraising and press doesn't mean success. In fact, the trendier the space, the less likely a big round means that the company is succeeding.

Of course, there are exceptions - the flipside is that a fundamental shift in technology may unlock the ability to solve problems that were previously unsolved. However, it means you are a solution looking for a problem, and that hardly ever works. 

During this phase, write down every single customer conversation. Be thorough and open ended in your questions. It's easy to get recency bias or you may want to come back to a detail that didn't seem important at the time. At PostHog, we built a Google Doc over 100 pages long in the first few weeks of doing this. Capture seemingly innocuous details. You never know if you'll re-use your hard-earned research with a different idea later.

Many people spend months or years attempting to validate their idea in advance and make no progress as a result. You will always get more clarity by doing something rather than hypothesizing. If an idea fails, there's zero downside to pivoting.

## Level 1 - Getting users to talk to you and validating the problem

Now that you _think_ there is a problem, you should figure out if others see the same issue. To do this, talk to them.

This can be very challenging - you're asking people to give up their time in the vague hope that you _might_ one day decide to solve their problem, if indeed they even have the problem. It's too late to tell you this, but the more helpful you've been to other people in your career, the easier you'll find this phase.

Here are a list of ways to get meetings, ranked from easiest to hardest:

1. people that you're buddies with "hey Joe, can I ask a favor"
1. people that you have worked with before - similar message to above
1. people that follow you on social media... if you have them!
1. people that have worked at the places you've worked with before "hey I'm also an alum of X"
1. introductions to people that are relevant via your friends or colleagues that already know them
1. people in professional networking groups. You'll need to give/take here. Figure out where these are - sometimes it's Slack, sometimes it's a paid network (like [Pavilion](www.joinpavilion.com)), sometimes it's meetups or forums
1. cold outreach (LinkedIn is probably easiest, if your target audience are there, since you can filter on job title - however, this means a lot of others are messaging them and low response rates)

When you send a message to people to get a meeting, unless you know them very well, be as concise as you can. That means 2-3 sentences - not a wall of text. Remember - anything you're doing on the internet is competing with cat videos.

Second, be clear with what you want both when you message them and during the meeting. If you want feedback, state that. If you want to sell to them, that should also be obvious. I am often willing to help an early stage founder learn that I do or do not have the problem they're solving (and most of the time it's the latter), but if I sense they're trying to sell me, I'll already know I don't want the product - so I won't take the call. Likewise, during the call, the techniques used to sell are the opposite of the techniques used to validate a customer's problems. You can always come back to a prospect to sell to them later if you've validated they have your problem.

Avoid heavily automated outreach at this stage. It's a waste of energy. Sure, hustle and send a lot of messages but don't set up dedicated software to mass email thousands of people - if you need to go to extremes to get anyone to talk to you, you're already in a failure mode because it shows you that no one cares.

Consider that you'll get different responsiveness from different groups of users. For example, you may find it impossible to get cold outreach to work for C level executives at a bank. Even if you've something that could help them - they are inundated with sales messages and you're getting lost in the noise. If you think your product is targeted at a particularly competitive group of people to get in front of, cold outreach may more or less stop working entirely. If your product _only_ works for Fortune 500s, I'd question if it's a good idea to build unless you've already got a huge network.

Speed matters. As extreme as it sounds - you should aim to respond within 30 seconds if someone messages you back. There is an enormous drop off in response when the person is no longer "talking to you" and has moved on to something else. In a past life, I once ran a call center business - if a customer had made a sales enquiry and we called them back within 5 minutes, we had a 90% greater chance of them booking time with us. Startups win on speed, this is an example of where you should be glued to your messages.

When users talk to you - beware that many will show interest out of politeness, or because they genuinely _could_ see themselves using your product one day. Neither will help you get actual usage. [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) provides plenty more information here if you want to learn more. If the problem is a high priority one to solve, then your potential users will have already gone to considerable lengths to solve it. Recalling the words of Dalton Caldwell, one of the YC partners we worked most closely with, "if a company has a crappy self built system that they're reliant on, there's probably a good business to be built providing exactly that product". In the early days of PostHog, we found that teams were building their own analytics infrastructure, instead of using the existing SaaS products, for more control of their data - invariably it was hideously complex to build, and underwhelming.

Try to find as specific a problem as you can. The clearer the problem is, the simpler it'll be for you to validate and solve it. Specificity doesn't just come from what your product _does_, it also comes from the _user_ you are targeting. For example, PayPal realized that power sellers on eBay had issues with payments.

And despite all this, there's only so much you can validate in this way.

You will get the clearest lessons from seeing if people _actually_ use, return to and pay for, your product - hence the need to move onto the next level. Do not lose too much time to validation in advance - this should be a quick, intense period. I'd view it as a weeks-not-months exercise.

At PostHog, we found it helpful to have Tim (my cofounder) coding constantly whilst I spend most of my time getting feedback in the early days. We were willing to throw away all our work. And we did, through five or six pivots. Having one of us constantly building meant we could validate more clearly by seeing if the most excited users would use our products, much more quickly.

If there's an obvious desire from the user to see if you can solve their problem, be ultra-accessible to these early potential users. People's emails are filled with junk, and they feel weirdly formal. Instead, get your customer setup on WhatsApp or in a private Slack channel or Discord as you share your solution with them. This communication will be critical throughout the rest of the levels.

You need to try to get out of this role into level 2 as quickly as possible - validating by seeing if users try to use it, instead of using only the conversations you're having. I'd advocate one cofounder focuses on this, whilst the other is continuously building then throwing things away as needed. To give a real-life example, Tim and I spent about 1 week in level 1 on average.

### Failure modes

Work your way from top to bottom:

* You aren't working hard enough.
  * Realize no one else is going to do this for you. Set a goal for how many meetings you want to get. I got 2 meetings a day, 5 days a week whilst doing any other random tasks like building our website. Try to get to all these in person if you can afford to do so. Most communication is non verbal, so it'll make it easier to learn what people are thinking. I'd encourage you to move to a hub for your industry if you can (and I'd also encourage moving in with your cofounder, which also means you can focus 100% on the work for this intense period - running out of momentum is your biggest risk).
* You aren't being clear what the problem is, so it's hard to recruit users to validate it.
  * Create a simple, single sentence description of the problem you think you're solving (ahead of doing the same for the _product_ you eventually build), and the user you are targeting. If what you're working on feels ultra vague, you'll get a lukewarm response to your messages trying to book meetings. Do not use benefits-language here - users won't have the attention span to figure out what your product does.
* You are talking to the wrong users - no one will take calls, or if they do, they don't have your problem.
  * Ask yourself - why did you have this problem, but those speaking to you don't? When you do get calls, ask who would have this problem. Change the user you are targeting.
* You aren't a good listener - you're doing calls, users are seemingly confirming that they have your problem but they don't use the product later.
  * Ask some open-ended questions to users in each call - perhaps you're close but not _quite_ right with your problem and target user statement. Ask your cofounder to shadow you on some calls and give each other direct feedback afterwards on which questions worked well. This may help you find a new problem, in case...
* The problem you want to solve isn't there.
  * Pivot. Find a new problem to solve.

## Level 2 - Getting users to use your product

!> You need to _keep_ talking to users throughout this step for feedback, but now you can validate better since you've some kind of product to show people. You should start this as soon as you have something for users to use.

The goal here is to see if people actually care, as quickly as possible. No matter how excited you get after interviewing people about their problems, there's no substitute for seeing what people _do_ instead of what they _say_. With one of the ideas Tim and I worked on before we pivoted to PostHog, we had 15 companies who "wanted to try it". We built a product, sent the invite link to them - and only _one_ even clicked the link and started using it. It's a good thing we hadn't spent 6+ months building the "perfect" product before this happened.

The most obvious users to start with here are those that you've already met during Level 1. During these calls, you should have been identifying a _problem_ that these users have. Now you have a _solution_ you should email them saying so!

## Failure modes

These are all the reasons why users may not be using your product:

* Users have no idea what your solution is, so they think it could be a waste of time.
  * Even if your product is free, people's time is not. The more senior your likely users, the stronger this effect. Can you work with someone that _reports_ to the person you were targeting to get things setup? If you struggle to get responsiveness, start questioning if something else on this causing issues - even a senior stakeholder will put in work to solve a major problem.
  * The way you explain your product matters. If it's complicated, people won't understand it. Describe it like you would when speaking to a friend.
  * Ask users if the above is why they didn't start using it. Explain that you are seeking direct feedback in your message or on a call.
* Users are sceptical your solution will solve the problem, so there's no point trying.
  * You may lack credibility. This is where design matters. If your website is a mess, your emails and the way you present yourself feel like you don't have it together, then another business won't want to spend time with you. At best, it'll be a waste of time, at worst, your product may be insecure or could cause them issues. Hopefully, during Level 0, you picked this idea because you've encountered it personally. That might mean you're well-qualified to solve it for others. Clarify your credentials, if relevant and impressive, when you interact with them. You are unlikely to get any feedback along these lines - as users probably won't want to tell you this, so they may go silent or - worse - they may give you misleading feedback that it's something else.
  * If, from your website, email or interactions with users, they disagree with your approach - then they're likely not to bother trying it. "Software can't solve a people problem", for example. "AI looks cool but won't work in real-life applications because it's not accurate enough".
* Users cannot access your solution.
  * Here's what happened with the very first PostHog users. Double/triple check it's possible to start using your product.

![a whatsapp screenshot of our first potential user telling us the login page was broken](../images/02/Screenshot-2020-02-25-at-21.52.15.png)

* Users are worried about using your solution.
  * Does your solution require, for example, a lot of personal or private company data to operate? Seek feedback "hey, I saw you've not used it yet - could I get some really blunt feedback. Did something put you off?" Can you reduce how much data you need access to, or can you make your product, website and approach feel more mature to signify competence? If the perceived security risk doesn't outweigh the benefit of solving the problem, the problem may not be big enough.
* Users don't want to solve this problem. Many problems aren't high priority and your solution feels like hassle to them. Can you make the product feel 10x simpler to use? Or 10x more compelling to them? If not...
  * Pivot to a new problem. Back to Level 0.
* Users don't really have the problem you thought they had from your interviews.
  * Pivot to a new problem. Back to Level 0.

## Level 3 - Making sure users are using your product repeatedly

Hooray, so people are showing up. Now you need to see if they're coming back or not. Figure out what your expected frequency is for usage, and check if that's roughly how often users are using your product. Users will return if you can repeatedly solve a problem for them.

Avoid relying on things like reminder emails or notifications purely designed to get users to log back into your product - if it takes this sort of effort to retain users, then the root cause is that the product isn't valuable, not that you're not reminding people to use it. Don't focus on features that don't make your product more powerful or easier to use.

Instead, once you've got some usage happening, get qualitative and quantiative feedback. Measure which features are being used the most, ask for feedback calls, and watch users using your product. There are plenty of good session replay tools, or if they're willing, ask them to perform tasks live in front of you and ask them why they clicked certain things - is it what you expect? You'll probably be shocked at how many ways people get confused - that's a _great_ problem to have if they're coming back.

Start "closing the loop" with users. This is a simple process to improve your product. It goes like this:

* User uses product
* You get feedback / insight / support questions (make it incredibly obvious how to reach you, and reach out to users in the channels they prefer)
* You build new feature or fix based on the above
* You go back to the user with the outcome of the above (like a link or gif to a new feature, or a clarification question), or you provide a detailed explanation if you couldn't do something
* Repeat the above

Closing the loop above is the way to cement your product market fit. As you do this, your product will get better - you should weight user feedback very heavily compared to your instincts around what to build. Second, it will bring you more users through word of mouth. The one thing you can compete on is speed - you can outperform any competitors by providing a ridiculously excellent experience to your early users. So they will tell their friends. Third, and best of all, it means that you will demonstrate to users that you listen to their feedback so that you get more feedback.

## Failure modes

* Users aren't activating. This means although they _signed up_, they aren't managing to _configure_ / really get started with your product properly. Therefore they _never_ get any value from it.
  * Activate your users manually. The classic example is the founders of Stripe who [used to visit their first users in person](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html#Manual) to integrate their product for them. Do things that don't scale. The bonus of this approach is that you'll get deeper customer interaction, so you'll learn more and you'll get a better relationship which will help you get more feedback.
  * Or make your activation simpler. Can you make it 10x simpler?
* You are getting conflicting feedback on what to build.
  * Go to Level 4, this will help clarify which users are your Ideal Customer Profile, and which aren't. Hopefully this exercise will help you pick a clearer direction. 
* Your product isn't solving your users' problem, hence there is no point coming back.
  * Build a new product for the same problem or fix your existing product. Then restart level 3.
* Your product is painful to use.
  * Get feedback from users, look at session replays or watch people trying to use it.
* Your users don't need to come back repeatedly.
  * Perhaps you've completely automatically solved the problem now with no further user work. Proceed to Level 4 and validate this by seeing if they will pay for it. Don't force product engagement if it's irrelevant to solving the problem.
* Your users used the product as you'd hope, but they don't experience this problem very often.
  * Proceed to Level 4. It may be hard to get significant revenue for an infrequent problem, or it may be that you don't experience much demand. If the number of users that experience this problem is huge even if the order value is tiny, that's ok. If it was extremely hard finding the first users _and_ it's hard to charge much for the product, this problem isn't a big enough one - go back to Level 0.

## Level 4 - Your first 5 reference customers

This will help you get your first customer and then it'll help you figure out your Ideal Customer Profile.

Write down needs, haves and attributes you think your Ideal Customer Profile users might have in common. These should be _very_ specific. They could be individual-level and/or company-level things.

Do not just assume one or two things like "engineers in startups with over 100 staff", definitely do not just list an industry. The specific things we considered at PostHog were:

* Needs
  * to control user data
  * to excel at product led growth to remain competitive
  * have budget and savvy engineers are the decision makers
  * do _not_ need to put us through a formal procurement process
* Haves
  * have achieved product market fit
  * have an unsuccessful centra analytics function
  * have products aimed at businesses
  * have deployed our open source product successfully
  * have used one of our free products

Feel free to include some anti-needs and haves too - things your Ideal Customer Profile _doesn't_ need or have.

List out all the potential users you could sell down the first column in a spreadsheet, and score them against all of these attributes. Color-code the spreadsheet so you can spot patterns easily. As you start to see if people are happy to pay 

Be upfront with customers. If you never set any commercial expectation with them early on, this step may prove tricky.  You probably didn't want to approach the topic as the last thing you wanted was to do anything that could scare them off. If this was the case, then consider you may find it easier to sell newer users who have had clearer expectations set. Use your website to make clear that your service is a paid one (perhaps, for example, once you're out of beta - and be clear around what that means too).

You will also need some pricing. You are likely to change this a bunch of times. Step 1 is to create some kind of internal table for you to use and iterate. Step 2 may be to make this transparent online and step 3 - for companies focusing on self-serve - is to enable people to pay without talking to you. Don't leap straight to self serve though, since you'll get fewer lessons from users - you're not trying to optimize revenue growth early on, you're trying to optimize your ability to learn.

Now it's to get your first reference customer. This means a customer that pays full list price, is using the product as you expect, and would happily recommend you to others.

# Company Design (to get this done as easily as possible)

## Deciding to work with a cofounder

If you're looking to build a huge, VC backed company, please just do this. It'll take a long time, there will be thousands of decisions to take. The only true way to fail is to give up. With the right person, you're more likely to persist with two people.

For a SaaS business, there are some principles I'd follow:

* ideally _both_ of you are technical. You need a machine than can rapidly get through the levels above - and your ability to ship software quickly is going to be the biggest blocker in the early days.
* critical: at least _one_ of you must be happy doing sales _most_ of the time. You don't need experience here, but you must embrace this challenge. There is a lot of sales in startups - recruiting early users, a team, investors and so on.
* critical: you _both_ must be happy to talk to users. The person who winds up writing the code the most, will need to fix problems with users - and is often better placed to understand them, so will still need to talk to users to do this well.

You are getting committed to something that may outlast the average marriage. Let that sink in. Your goal is never to be right, it's to get good at figuring problems out together.

Treat each other as partners. Failure mode is when the CEO bosses the CTO around and makes all the decisions. Then you aren't cofounders. There are a few ways we've done this:

* Company design / people and hiring / culture
  * The company is the parent product you are building - and it's the one input you can directly control. You should both think frequently about what kind of company you want to build together, and the people and hiring/culture decisions/behaviors you build are the most important part of getting there.
* Strategy / vision
  * Whilst one cofounder may drive, the other is closely involved. If you can't get on the same page as each other, it'll be 10x worse for everyone else.
* Be willing to swap responsibilities around to play to your strengths. A few examples of things that have caused us to swap things around:
  * The first $1M in sales are different to scaling to $10M.
  * Pre-product market fit and post-product market fit may require a different approach to product.  
* Board / fundraising
  * This ties closely to company strategy. Whilst the CEO should do _all_ investor calls, so the other can drive the business in the meantime, it's important to keep in touch with each other on progress.
  * Conscious effort to keep the other cofounder updated on fundraising - shared notes, weekly discussion
  * Cofounders both attend board meetings / existing investor catchups and have areas they cover

## How to work together in the early days 

Live together. For those that this is the most painful (I'm looking at you, people with families), living together for a set period is the most advantageous. It allows you to focus on getting things off the ground when your ability to get work done is the bottleneck for everything. One of the most impactful things about doing YC was having a socially exceptable excuse to do nothing other than work for 3 months. It was unsustainable 

Define your roles clearly - divide and conquer. Tim wrote code, I did everything else - finding users, the website, product design in Figma, and grocery shopping. Try not to interrupt each other - we wrote up discussion topics during the day and then went through them together when we both weren't trying to get something else done.

Weekly sprints. This makes you prioritize what to work on. They shouldn't be longer as that's too slow. Any faster means you'll spend too much time talking and not doing. The latter gives you the clearest lessons.

Daily standups. This makes you accountable to getting your work done. List out what you got done yesterday and what you plan to do today.

Optimize for not breaking up. I'm an advocate for 50:50 equity and pay if suggested by the "more experienced" person - this means you're really partners, and it reduces an area that could cause resentment. Any difference in experience will become irrelevant after a few years anyway.

## Spending money

Spend as little as you can. If you want to complete a computer game, you don't play it at double speed.

Mainly, do _not_ hire anyone until you've got product market fit. This simply gives you longer to get there, and if the two of you can't get it, no one else stands a chance.

There are a couple of things I _would_ spend a little more on than may feel comfortable (but they're things that have minimal impact compared to hiring). I'm an advocate for a decent computer and your own room if you're living together. The former means you don't get pulled out of your flow and the latter means some privacy so you can decompress when you really need to. Do whatever works for you. Gym membership will be worth it too.

"But investors will judge us on our growth rate". Yep, but that'll be a million times higher if you hit product market fit properly versus faking it with paid ads or ineffective salespeople. At the early stages, it's the last few months of data not the first few months that matter anyway.

## Motivation

If you aren't excited about what you're working on, pivot. It's as simple as that. You're going to go a lot further if you're working on something that feels like it's _your_ startup versus someone else's.

Even if you already know each other well (which I hope you do), talk deeply about motivation with your cofounder as early as possible - ideally before you start working together. These are the types of questions to ask.

* how long are we willing to try to hit product market fit?
* how long can we afford to try?
* do we want to raise money or bootstrap the company?
* what will you want to look back on having achieved when you're 80?
* what sort of company do you want to run? How would it look and feel day to day?
* what roles would we each have? Will you feel happy about this in 5 years?
* would you sell for $1M / $10M / $100M / $1Bn?
* what kind of work do you want to do / what don't you want to do?

## Pivots

It feels scary to pivot.

A lot of the hustle/grind culture around startups would make you think that the very best startups took years and years of work to get off the ground. The reality, once we got into YC, was the opposite. It felt like the _majority_ of the best companies there pivoted - most ideas people were working on needed to change.

Whatever you do, if you pivot, is have a clear view of which level you're going back to. Do not try to get an existing solution that you've built to solve a new problem - think through a new problem from scratch.

## Strategy

Your startup is like a boat exploring the ocean. A good strategy means that when you discover land, that it's going to be lush - with plenty of food, cute animals and nice beaches.

PostHog's early strategy was simply "open source", as we knew this would give us some early adoption and long term we thought we could sell to those that needed self hosting (the latter turned out to be correct but not the most important thing to focus on). This got more elaborate when we got larger and had more insight into the market - now it's "help engineers be better at product", with three main ways we approach that (i) provide all the tools they need in one (ii) get in before our competitors (iii) be the main customer and product data pipeline.

If you're selling into a busy space, you should make sure people get how you're different. You can be very successful even with a lot of competition - in fact I think it means you're more likely to hit product market fit - the challenge is no longer if your product is useful, but it is how well you can differentiate. PostHog's main difference in the early days was the user we were targeting - our competitors targeted a non technical audience, whereas we targeted a technical one. That meant whilst our competitors put whitepapers on their websites, we put cartoon hedgehogs. Whilst they did outbound sales, we didn't hire a single salesperson. Whilst they didn't list pricing on their pricing pages, we did. Longer term, we considered their products as point solutions whereas we decided to build all the tools in one. And so on. Building our entire _company_, not just our _software_, around our target users resulted in brand and word of mouth.

# Skills you will need

## Design

This, especially applied to your website, is probably more important than you think.

When it comes to the website, most people will grab a template to get something thrown together quickly.

Cory, PostHog's lead designer, and self-proclaimed webmaster, put this really nicely "we didn't start by thinking we could build the slickest website, so we built one that felt different instead".

When it comes to the product, you want to ship a competent-feeling product, but in most cases, it doesn't need to be best-in-class. I'd argue that your website's design is _more_ important when you're in a phase of trying to get anyone to sign up, since it's probably where you're losing 90% or more of potential sign ups.

The good news is that design starts with copy. If you get simple, clear language onto your website - that explains what you _do_, and meets the other use cases your visitors may have -, then you're ahead of 75% of other websites.

Don't worry about pixel perfection. I once met (Malthe Sigurdsson)[https://twitter.com/malthe], who ran design at Stripe. I went into the conversation expecting to hear that they spent months and months in Figma before shipping anything. Instead, he told me that great designers are fast and iterative. They don't get things perfect first time around.

## Building stuff

As with most early stage startup stuff, you're more likely to be wrong than right (the vast majority of startups fail, after all), so optimize for this scenario.

You are trying to figure out if anyone cares - the speed you can ship your first feature is the most important factor, and scalability is irrelevant. Use a software stack you've used before, as long as it's reasonably popular. We used django and React in the early days.

Ship features embarassingly early. The kind of user that'll pick up a random piece of software that no one has ever used before, is an early adopter - unless your software's main priority is being better designed, then it's much more preferable to ship clunky/ugly/slightly broken functionality and quickly improve it, than to waste months on something no one cares about.

## Dealing with existing users

Aside from closing the loop, don't put anyone or anything between the person writing the code and your users. This will slow you down and will cause confusion. Moreover, it's likely a better experience for a user to spend time with the person that actually built the product. It is more effective in the long run to productize answers to users' problems, than it is to spent lots of time triaging issues... which wind up with you or your engineers anyway.

Set a clear responsibility for this with your cofounder. When Tim and I started getting users, I kept trying to get _more_ users whilst he focused completely on our existing ones.

Remember that users are human beings (I imagine), and your success entirely depends on them. Make sure their experience with you is a joyful one. The way you even open a call sets the tone for the whole conversation - be happy and energetic to be there! Do the legwork for them - it shows them that their opinions are valued and thus they'll keep interacting with you. That means writing up your notes and creating issues or features in response, all of which you send to them. It means responding quickly to them - within minutes if you can.

## Sales

When you're trying to get to product market fit, do _not_ prioritize scaling your sales. Just focus on getting 1 deal done at a time. Here is how to do that:

1. Intros through your own network, people you worked with, went to school with, where your family work or went to school. Everybody has _some_ network - don't feel like you need to be a sales legend to do this.
2. If you're in an accelerator, message other companies. Be personalized.
3. People from companies that your product is perfect for.
4. Events. You may be able to get free tickets via a partner.

In general, do not do marketing (paid ads / content) expecting to get a sale - these are more scalable methods. Be hands on. Other companies in your space will have heavily invested in how to do outbound or marketing, so the most likely way you can win is on quality and personalization with your approach.

Keep yourself accountable - set some goals for meetings booked and stick to them.

As with booking feedback calls, be hyper responsive. If you respond to people within minutes (whether booking a meeting, or progressing a deal), you'll get them whilst they're available and happy to engage. I used to obsessively respond to people on LinkedIn all day whilst in this phase.

When it comes to pricing, reduce the risk for your earliest customers. Charge them monthly rather than annually (unless they've a preference for the latter - for example because they've a formal procurement process and rigid annual budgets).

There are multiple methods available. You can charge a recurring monthly rate, or you can charge on usage.

Once you're on a call, get the prospect to open up about their challenges, and figure out with them if your product could solve their problems. It's worth qualifying the lead as you do this. The simplest method is BANT:

* Budget
* Authority
* Need
* Timeline

Layer your questions.

* Level 1 - "what are the requirements for this project?", "how will you pick a vendor?", "do you have a set budget?"
* Level 2 - "this sounds important, why?", "would you consider a product that didn't include that feature?" and so on. 
* Level 3 - "if your end users were thoroughly trained and using this product effecitvely, what impact would that have on your revenue?", "what does solving this mean for you?".

Prioritize time with those that are best-qualified.

Once someone decides to move forward, you'll need something for people to sign. YC provide a [free sales agreement](https://www.ycombinator.com/sales_agreement/) for SaaS companies. Be flexible around your earliest customers for the terms they need - it's not about maximizing revenue or contract length, it's about getting your first deal signed and learning.

## Pivoting

First, realize it's normal to pivot. Since most startups fail, you're probably doing something wrong if you _don't_ pivot. The media would make you think that building a startup requires years of grinding away on the same idea. At PostHog, we pivoted six times in the first six months.

Be decisive. During our YC batch, we saw a few companies have one founder work on X, whilst another worked on Y. The problem of finding product market fit is already complex, so don't add any extra variables like "just one of us was trying, not both" to make it even harder. Pick one idea and go all in. If you fail, quickly move to the other idea. We also saw instances where companies debated pivoting for several weeks - if you have tried everything in the list above, and are questioning yourself constantly, then you probably should have already made the call.

_When_ you do pivot, do _not_ become a solution looking for a problem. It is very easy to become attached to your existing code or problem. Be especially wary of very fractional pivots. For example, one of our first ideas was a tool to monitor tech debt - it would insert a survey as a GitHub check asking the engineer where they encountered problems and how long was wasted. We had to pivot when it was impossible to sell it - since the insight it provided wasn't being _acted_ upon by teams, so they got little real value. When then moved into using the same surveys to monitor engineering happiness, re-using our code - the result? A week of wasted meetings.
