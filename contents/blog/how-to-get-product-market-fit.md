Getting to product market fit is like a giant game of snakes and ladders. You can fail in multiple places and need to drop back a step, or even pivot completely. It is not an adventure that takes you in a straight line.

Although many lessons are universal, here's a guide tailored to b2b software. It's based on what we learned at PostHog going first through 5 or 6 pivots, then growing zero to $MM in revenue, and 20K+ customers.

# The Product Market Fit Game

## Level 0 - Choosing a problem to work on

Start by solving a problem you've had yourself. It needs to be a big problem, that you've actually tried to solve too - if it's something you've never attempted to fix, then it isn't a big enough problem.

Some people spend months or years thinking about this and make no actual progress as a result. You learn more by trying something out than hypothesizing. If you fail, try something else!

The type of idea you have will greatly influence your life.

If you work on a problem that others tackle, you are likely to find it easier to validate the problem, but your solution must be very different - if you want to build a venture scale business, then your solution must be 10x better or 10x cheaper for significant numbers of people to use or pay for it.

Alternatively, if you work on a problem no one has tackled, then you mus Overall, though, competition will likely have very li

Be especially wary about building what's trendy. Be wary that you'll feel pressure from some VCs to work on the latest technology, and you'll see other companies in the trendiest spaces raising a bunch of money and getting PR. Do not be fooled - neither of these things mean success. This will put you in the "solution finding a problem" category, which doesn't work. Of course, there are exceptions - the flipside is that a fundamental shift in technology may unlock the ability to solve problems that were previously unsolved. However, it means you are a solution looking for a problem, and that hardly ever works. 

## Level 1 - Validating the problem and getting users to talk to you

Now that you _think_ there is a problem, you should start seeing if others see the same issue. To get meetings, prioritize:

1. people that you're buddies with "hey Joe, can I ask a favor"
1. people that you have worked with before - similar message to above
1. people that follow you on social media... if you have them!
1. people that have worked at the places you've worked with before "hey I'm also an alum of X"
1. introductions to people that are relevant via your friends or colleagues that already know them
1. people in professional networking groups. You'll need to give/take here. Figure out where these are - sometimes it's Slack, sometimes it's a paid network (like [Pavilion](www.joinpavilion.com)), sometimes it's meetups or forums
1. cold outreach (LinkedIn is probably easiest, if your target audience are there, since you can filter on job title - however, this also means very low response rates since everyone is doing it)

When you're trying to get these calls, there are some important tips:

- be concise. 2-3 lines max. A wall of text is self-interested, and most people won't read it.
- be clear what you want. Do not say you're looking for feedback then in practise use every call as a sales pitch - it's misleading, it means you'll be pitching rather than focussing on blunt feedback, and it's unlikely you'll manage to skip all the way to the sales step in one go. By listening and responding to what you hear well, when - later in the process - you start to pitch, you're far more likely to have success.

Avoid heavily automated outreach like the plague, at this stage. It's a waste of energy. Sure, hustle and send a lot of messages but don't set up dedicated software to mass email thousands of people - if you need to go to extremes to get anyone to talk to you, you're already in a failure mode because it shows you that noone cares.

Consider that you'll get different responsiveness from different groups of users. For example, you may find it impossible to get cold outreach to work for C level executives at a bank. Even if you've something that could help them - they are inundated with sales messages and you're getting lost in the noise. If you think your product is targeted at a particularly competitive group of people to get in front of, cold outreach may more or less stop working entirely. If your product _only_ works for Fortune 500s, I'd question if it's a good idea to build unless you've already got a huge network.

When users talk to you - beware that many will show interest out of politeness, or because they genuinely _could_ see themselves using your product one day. Neither will help you get actual usage. [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) provides plenty more information here if you want to learn more. If the problem is a high priority one to solve, then your potential users will have already gone to considerable lengths to solve it. In the words of Dalton Caldwell, our partner during the batch, "if a company has a crappy self built system that they're reliant on, there's probably a good business to be built providing exactly that product". In the early days of PostHog, we found that teams were building their own analytics infrastructure, instead of using the existing SaaS products, for more control of their data - invariably it was hideously complex to build, and underwhelming.

Try to find as specific a problem as you can. The clearer the problem is, the simpler it'll be for you to validate and solve it.

There's only so much you can validate in this way. You will get the clearest lessons from seeing if people _actually_ use, return to and pay for, your product. Do not lose too much time to validation in advance - this should be a quick, intense period.

At PostHog, we found it helpful to have Tim (my cofounder) coding constantly whilst I spend most of my time getting feedback in the early days. We were willing to throw away all our work. And we did, through five or six pivots. Having one of us constantly building meant we could validate more clearly by seeing if the most excited users would use our products, much more quickly.

### Failure modes

Work your way from top to bottom:

* You aren't trying
  * Solution: set a goal for how many meetings you want to get. I tried to get 2 meetings a day. If you live in a tech hub (which I'd encourage in the early days at least), go to all of these in person. Most communication is non verbal, so it'll make it easier to learn what people are thinking.
* You aren't being clear what the problem is
  * Solution: make sure you can describe your product in one, very short sentence. Practise this over and over again. Similarly, a lot of people look at much larger competitors that use confusing enterprise terminology.
* You are talking to the wrong stakeholders
  * Solution: why did you have this problem, but those speaking to you don't?
* The problem you want to solve isn't there
  * Solution: pivot

## Level 2 - Getting users to use your product



## Level 3 - Making sure users are using your product repeatedly

## Level 4 - Your first sale

## Level 5 - Your first 5 reference customers



# Designing your company to do the above as easily as possible

## Get a cofounder

## How to work together in the early days 

Weekly sprints. This makes you prioritize what to work on. They shouldn't be longer as that's too slow. Any faster means you'll spend too much time talking and not doing!

Daily standups. This makes you accountable to getting your work done. List out what you got done yesterday and what you plan to do today.

## Your personal life

## Finance

## Equipment - hardware and software]

## Pivots

Fun fact, we did this 6 ish times at PostHog.

# Skills you will need

## Go To Market

## Design

## Engineering

## Product


# Ignore below - crap from another article i nearly wrote




We built roughly a new startup every month for the first 6 months of working together, before we built PostHog.

If you get to the end of this list, you should keep going as you're probably on the way to product market fit.

* the MVP is complete and you've launched it
* you've spoken to potential users and they've signed up
* you've spoken to users and have incorporated their feedback
* your users keep using it
* you've sold it for money
* you can do the above 5x more fairly easily

If you got to the end, you shouldn't pivot. Oh, and you're probably en route to a life changing outcome!

## I'm not ready for users yet

You cannot truly validate an idea without trying it. You have to find a way to figure out if anyone will use it faster.

## No one wants to talk to me

Either you aren't explaining the problem you solve clearly, you aren't actually trying to talk to users, or the problem isn't a problem people have any interest in solving with you.

Be very clear with what you're asking for, and the problem you solve.

Approach potential users being transparent. "Hey I'm building a startup to solve problem X, I'm trying to get some early user feedback - I was curious if this is a problem you have?" This rules out people say no to you because you're trying to sell. 

If you're hustling through those you know, and sending thoughtful, clear messages, and no one will take a call, pick a new problem.

## No one will sign up

Either the problem you're solving isn't serious enough, or your solution doesn't look like it'll solve it.

## No one will give me feedback

* If you're getting literally no feedback, it's a sign that no one cares. If they _needed_ your product, they'd be more engaged.

If you want to get more, show users that you listen and act on feedback.

<INSERT IMAGE OF A SLACK DISCUSSION WHERE WE DO THIS>

How you're trying to get feedback matters.

* We get 20x higher response rates through Slack. We've recently started doing this in our product directly too.
* Be specific and make it easy for users to respond to you. What type of feedback is most useful?
* We're experimenting with asking inside the app.

## My users churn

First, how often would you expect a user to need to use your product?

## Selling it for money



## My customers feel different

Now you're tryign to repeat the process. Ideally, you can repeatedly sell the same thing, with the same technique.
