## What's the downside of sending this type of event?

This change is designed for price-sensitive teams that are looking to reduce their spending on analytics (often but not always hobbyists or indie developers without funding and a large number of low value users, such as someone bootstrapping a b2c product, or alternatively an extremely high volume business trying to optimize a very high spend more carefully). If you send persons without properties, there are some downsides of this tradeoff:

* users' profiles won't have any properties set (such as email addresses), so you won't be able to identify specific users
* you can't filter your visualizations based on user properties, or adjust targeting of cohorts based on them
* you won't be able to track users across multiple visits or across different devices - they will show up as separate users

All of our functionality, with the above limitations, will still work even at this dramatically lower price.

## FAQs

* Is this change sustainable?
  * yes!
    * out of all the major competitors we have, we believe we are by far the most efficient - we are 100% inbound and grow through word of mouth
    * this pricing still reflects us making a positive margin on every event sold
    * we suspect this will increase our word of mouth growth and increase our retention, so we are likely to make more revenue with this change, but at a lower margin
    * the majority of our customers use multiple products that we offer, so we wind up making a little money off a lot of products - our competitors are not as wide, so we believe long term we can undercut
