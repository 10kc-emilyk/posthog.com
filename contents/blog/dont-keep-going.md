We built roughly a new startup every month for the first 6 months of working together, before we built PostHog.

If you get to the end of this list, you should keep going as you're probably on the way to product market fit.

* the MVP is complete and you've launched it
* you've spoken to potential users and they've signed up
* you've spoken to users and have incorporated their feedback
* your users keep using it
* you've sold it for money
* you can do the above 5x more fairly easily

If you got to the end, you shouldn't pivot.

## I'm not ready for users yet

You cannot truly validate an idea without trying it. You have to find a way to figure out if anyone will use it faster.

## No one wants to talk to me



## No one will sign up

Either the problem you're solving isn't serious enough, or your solution doesn't look like it'll solve it.

## No one will give me feedback

* If you're getting literally no feedback, it's a sign that no one cares. 

If you want to get more, show users that you listen and act on feedback.

How you're trying to get feedbac matters.

* We get 20x higher response rates through Slack. We've recently started doing this in our product directly too.
* Be specific and make it easy for users to respond to you. What type of feedback is most useful?
* We're experimenting with asking inside the app.

## My users churn

First, how often would you expect a user to need to use your product?

## Selling it for money



## My customers feel different

Now you're tryign to repeat the process. Ideally, you can repeatedly sell the same thing, with the same technique.
