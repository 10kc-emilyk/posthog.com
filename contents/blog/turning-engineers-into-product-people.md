The worst thing you can do to an engineer is micromanage their every move. Engineers are inherent problem solvers who have as much interest in fixing a failing product (or improving a good one) as any product manager is. Not giving an engineer the space to contribute ideas and execute solutions spells death for any startup with grand ambitions because the best engineers can simply leave and join a company that’ll give them the autonomy they seek.

At PostHog, one of our core values is autonomy. New devs and non-techies who start at PostHog are usually surprised by the lack of micromanagement, onerous KPIs, and death by meetings. This is deliberate, as people can only do their best work when given the freedom to do so. We run two-week sprints where everyone decides what they’re going to work on for the next 14 days and run a retrospective session at the end of each sprint. Not only is more impactful work done this way, but new problems are also discovered and solved during each sprint that weren’t originally planned for. For example, two of our main features - [session recording](https://posthog.com/product-features/session-recording) and [feature flags](https://posthog.com/product-features/feature-flags) - were ideated during one of our hackathons at a company offsite. The whole concept of our hackathons revolves around experimentation, and when you give engineers the freedom to play around with new ideas, magical things happen.

## Speed

The keyword here is _speed_. At PostHog, your speed of iteration is more important than anything else - we’d rather you moved fast and broke things (and fixed them just as quickly) than spend eons working on the perfect solution to a problem. That’s why we encourage everyone to publish one pull request a day - even if the work is unfinished. Product thinking means accepting that the product will never be perfect - and that’s ok. We also believe that the best way to become a great product manager is to build great products from the jump, so we don’t give any special product training to new devs. Of course, if any of our devs want to gain extra experience through books, conferences, and outside training, we’ve got a generous budget for all those things that they can [freely spend](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/spending-money).

## Hiring product-minded engineers

Many companies shoot themselves in the foot with their engineering job descriptions. With autonomy being such a critical requirement, many devs are especially sensitive to certain keywords in job descriptions that might indicate red flags with your management style or company culture. For example, ‘close collaboration with product’ might give off the idea that product runs the show and that engineering merely exists to do the PM’s bidding. Calling the engineering team a generic term like ‘IT’ is another red flag that would turn off any self-respecting engineer. No dev wants to be treated like a second-rate citizen at a company they work for.

You can get a sense of a dev’s project ownership during the hiring phase. At PostHog, we select for entrepreneurial candidates - people who’ve founded companies or worked on side projects in the past. Not only are such people more likely to think outside the box, but they’re also more likely to be [intrapreneurs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrapreneur.asp) - people who solve problems and generate profitable solutions with the full backing of their company. Whether they’ve risen up the ranks at one company or hopped from one startup to another makes no difference to us - all we care about is whether they learned new stuff, grew continuously, and became better colleagues and product builders.

We also don’t care whether you dropped out of college or attained a PhD - experience and entrepreneurship are not tied to qualifications. Most people greatly underestimate the four-year head-start one gets by skipping college, especially for a field like computer science where everything you need to know is a Google search away. All else being equal, an ambitious engineering dropout gains four years of practical experience and several salary bumps while a fresh graduate only has theoretical experience and likely crippling student debt. But that’s a conversation for another day.

Beyond iteration speed, risk-taking, and a honed intuition for problem-solving, we’re also looking for _curiosity_ - a willingness to ask endless questions about the problem and any proposed solutions. For example, is there another way we could structure the dashboard view? Do we really need 3 buttons here or will two do? This feature lets them see how much traffic they’re getting - but what do they actually care about? A previously unused feature saw a sharp increase in usage after our last UI update - what changed? These are the types of questions we expect from product-minded engineers.

As of writing, we’ve got 12 engineers and are looking to double that number within the next 12 months. Expanding your engineering team introduces all sorts of interesting challenges, from the kind of work each person can do to how we distribute ownership of output. We’ve instituted the concept of [Small Teams](https://posthog.com/handbook/people/team-structure/why-small-teams) at PostHog over the past few months and have enjoyed immense success with it. More work gets done faster as new problems are spotted and fixed by more focused team members. Every Small Team has its own leader, but top management merely provides support and direction. Our Small Teams initiative is also under iteration and will get tweaked or dropped where necessary.

## Do you need a VP of Product?

When you’re turning all your engineers into product people, it can be hard to justify hiring a VP of Product. But we’ve got a good reason for that. At the moment, our product is built for (and loved by) engineers at each of our client companies, but we’ve only got shallow product-market fit. We’ve hit a snag where anyone even slightly non-technical than an engineer (say, a product manager) fails to extract the full value of our product. This hampers wider adoption within those companies. Our new VP of Product will bring a sense of direction and long-term vision to the product, in line with our current mission to delight just five core customers. The VP Product’s job will be to dig deep into what makes those Big Five tick, what they care about in the product, and what new features they’d like to see added or nixed. They’ll also continue to turn our devs into product people, providing training and coaching where needed.

## Tap into talent

Engineers are becoming increasingly mission-driven creators who want to deeply understand what the user struggles with and how to alleviate those struggles. We talk to many engineers during the hiring process who reveal that they’re leaving their current companies because there’s simply no room to create stuff - either because they’re not given the autonomy to do so or because the product(s) they worked on lacked sufficient usage to track trends and test new features. Good engineers are scarce, and if you’ve been lucky enough to snag a few bright stars, don’t hesitate to hand over the keys to the kingdom and watch what they build with it. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.
