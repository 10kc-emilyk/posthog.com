Covid-19 forced companies to implement remote working across their operations. This led to disruptions in business workflows and profits as they scrambled to work out how to communicate internally, track outputs, maintain a sense of belonging, keep their business engines running remotely. At PostHog, we've built a remote-first company culture from the start - and this has brought us many benefits. Here are five elements that buffered our company from the pandemic's worst effects - and helped sustain a healthier, more profitable company.

## Keeping things human

With 20+ employees spread out across five continents, we're aware of how little we get to see each other in real life. This is why we are a little less stringent in our weekly meetings to allow for time to catch-up on our lives outside work. While this might extend our already brief meetings, we've found that allowing a little divergence in meetings helps everyone feel like they belong to a team that cares, not some robotic overlord.

Also, we've set up 'Life Stories' every 2 weeks - hour-long sessions where one member of the team tells their life story through slides, stories, and photos. For example, Marius, our technical lead, once had a parachute accident in Estonia and had to walk for two hours through the woods to get help. Another staff member entered a Top 5 list for memorizing pi digits. These little stories help everyone build a fuller picture of their colleagues - and can spark realizations around shared interests.

## Trust
If you don't trust your employees, you shouldn't have hired them in the first place. At PostHog, we extend trust to our staff members in everything we do, from work output to spending company money. For example, we don't track hours - not only because it would be an administrative nightmare to try and reconcile submitted time-tracking reports, but also because output is what matters - not butts in seats. Secondly, leave days are permissionless at PostHog - this means that you can put in leave whenever you like without needing approval - as long as your workload is sorted for the period you're gone. This means that staff members can take some time off to rest, work on personal projects, or run errands as needed.

Lastly, we give everyone at PostHog a company credit card with a set monthly limit that can be raised as needed. Purchases below a certain limit ($75 as of writing) don't need to be explained - staff members can make such purchases at their discretion. Any purchases larger than those amounts merely require a receipt and a memo to identify the purchase - but other than that, we don't micromanage staff spending. We trust your staff to use their privileges prudently, and we haven't had any issues so far with the initiative.

## Iteration
Perfection is the enemy of progress, and at PostHog we encourage rough takes published regularly over perfect work submitted sporadically. There are 2 main reasons for this: streamlining and quality assurance.

Your pull request (the main way we make changes to our website and platform) might be required before another pull request can go through. It's thus important that everyone publishes regularly to relive any bottlenecks in the workflow.

Secondly, publishing regularly makes it easier for other team members to spot mistakes and correct them early on. As an open-source product built on transparency, we extend this philosophy to our work output, too.

Iteration is even more important for fast-growing remote teams, and technical teams can especially benefit from adopting an iterative approach to delivering work.

## Diversity
It's a no-brainer that diversity strengthens teams, and remote working allows you to deliberately hire people from different places and backgrounds. We've got team members in the US, the UK, Estonia, Congo, South Africa, the Ukraine, and other countries. We range all ages from 19 (our youngest dev) to 40-something (our business head, Charles). Some have advanced degrees in their field, others have degrees in fields totally unrelated to their current roles, and others are self-taught gurus who skipped or dopped out of college altogether. This cauldron of experiences and expertise generates better ideas that fortify our remote work model.

## Antifragility and fundraising
PostHog is an antifragile company - one that has mastered remote-working in the wake of COVID-19 and has processes in place to ensure everyone does their best work and can bring their best selves to the workplace. This means we can build a better product, serve our customers [better and faster]( https://twitter.com/marcusgadbem/status/1352966040175714304), and reach profitability more quickly. All of these facts make it easier to raise funding when needed, as evidence by the fact that we've now raised a Series B round in less than 2 years. 

The old in-office model of working won't go away - people will always want to interact with their co-workers and customers live. But adapting to the remote-work approach in the wake of COVID-19 is not just following trends - it's also good business. How have you been adapting to remote work lately?
