PostHog's mission is to increase the number of successful products in the world. It's why we made [Discoveries](https://posthog.com/handbook/product/metrics) our [north-star metric](https://posthog.com/blog/north-star-metrics) for success. The more discoveries our customers are making, the better we're doing.

It's also why we've created this continually updated and crowdsourced list of cool things you can do in PostHog. Whether you're new to PostHog or a veteran user, we hope you'll find something in this list to inspire you.

**Why?** This is great when presenting and explaining insights in meetings. Going full screen makes all the insights larger and easier to understand, and stops participants fixating on the 58 tabs you have open. "They are all essential tabs, ok?"
