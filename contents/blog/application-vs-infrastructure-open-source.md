Alt. title: "Application vs infrastructe open source startups"
Outline:
- Defining application layer
  - Examples of application layer: GitLab, HashiCorp?, Sentry, Mattermost  
- Defining Infrastructure layer
  - "Essentially SaaS apps that you can self host"
  - Examples of infrastructure layer: Docker, Gatsby, TimescaleDB 
- Differences, similarities
- Why you should build an application layer open source startup
  - Defensibility against AWS
  - 'Mindset', ie people are used to paying for applications but not for infrastructure software. Linux is free
  - Ease of monitisation. Application layer is as easy as adding premium features and charging for those with a license key. Infrastructure basically forced to go down cloud route
- Risks of going down this route
  - No great story for application layer software
  - Harder to monitise than straight SaaS


Introduction
In the last two years of talking with founders, VCs and users of open source software I've noticed an increasingly clear divide between two types of open source companies. It's a divide that not many people are aware exists. However, if you're thinking of starting an open source startup it could be the difference between having a wildly successful exit like GitLab or years of muddling along, as was is the case for Docker. The difference? GitLab is an application layer startup while Docker is an infrastructure layer startup.



Conclusion
Infrastructure layer open source projects are super important, but the VC model just doesn't work as well for creating a long term, sustainable outcomes.
