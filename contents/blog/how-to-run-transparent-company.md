## Who this is for

I'm gearing this around _internal_ transparency, for startups. PostHog (like a handful of others) shares _most_ of this stuff externally too.

## Why this matters

I _cannot believe_ that more companies don't do this stuff. It is in the top five most impactful decisions we've made.

Above all, it enables people to work autonomously. There are two ways to grow a team - autonomy, or control. We chose the former because it's the kind of place we'd want to work, and therefore it makes it a better place to work for our team. That lets us hire and retain stronger people.

Transparency works particularly well in an all remote company. Like ours. It makes asynchronous work much easier.

We didn't expect this, but hiring has been _a gazillion times_ easier because of this too. Since we share most of the below publicly, people thinking about working here can build trust much more easily, and it makes us stand apart from the thousands of other startups.

There are probably some startups where this doesn't work. Perhaps in design led companies, where control is more important than autonomy, or in companies that aren't managed consistently - you can't share a non-existent pay structure, for example (and, yes, it is hard work to implement something like that from very early, but we felt that work was worth it to prevent unfairness and employee churn).

## General communication

### Tool minimalism

There will be so much context available, that you need to be a little more mindful of making it easy to find stuff.

The simplest way to keep things easy to find, is to have fewer places to look.

Broadly for us this means:

* Pull Requests > Issues > Public Slack Channels > Private groups or Slack DMs > Email

### Highlighting what matters

Now you've got everything being shared, so that's probably a lot of stuff.

We use a weekly 30 mins all hands (including written notes) to highlight what really matters across all teams.

It has:

* Top level news - any major things to note
* Revenue - this is an output of all the other teams working well
* OKRs - are we on track or not for each key result, and any extra context
* Handpicked list of any important policy changes
* Demos - if people have something cool to show that they built, they can show it off

## Finance

* Fundraising


* Stock options

People should know what % of the company they own, their strike price, the terms of their options, and 


At some stage, we'll do more here - letting people model what options are worth depending on how the company performs, for example.


* Financial reports (profit/loss/balance etc)

This should be copy pasta from your board slides. We share the monthly reports our accountants create with our team.

Building product

* How last sprint went
* What the plan is for the next sprint
* Issues

Strategy

* OKRs, including _why_ they were picked
* Board meeting slides

People

* Pay structure

Overall, our pay and communication around it, is designed to make pay "get out of the way". 

We have a system (TODO INSERT LINK TO CALCULATOR) for paying everyone here. This means we can justify for every team member exactly why they're paid. We proactively review this every few months and make adjustments if the market or performance has changed.

We don't share individuals' pay details with each other as it's the only area we don't want employee feedback. Quite simply, if people influence each others' pay, then it would make the process of giving and receiving direct feedback harder. We don't want people to have to be defensive with each other.

* Hiring (and "not-hiring") decisions

This is a new one we're working to introduce.

When a candidate gets to the final stage of our hiring process, we share with the wider company the decision we made.

This let's our team level each other up at decision making, it increases accountability (and, thus, inclusivity).

* Firing decisions (when for performance reasons)

If someone leaves for performance reasons, we'll communicate to the rest of the company what went wrong. Sometimes that means running a post-mortem on the hiring process too, which is also shared.

* Holidays

Sharing this one means people realize more easily if their colleagues are working or not. We use CharlieHR integrated with Slack to do this.

* Personal readmes

These are a fun one - team members write out how they can help others, what their focus is, and quirks of working with them. We borrowed the idea from Sid's at GitLab, but extended it to everyone. We make them optional, but quite a few people do them.

TODO INSERT SOME EXAMPLE PERSONAL READMES

# You don't have to do this all at once

Some of this list may require you to improve your company's general processes and management to even be able to share them properly. That's fine. Ultimately, doing the things here, will create deep trust between your team, and it'll make you think through your decisions more carefully. That has to be worth it.
