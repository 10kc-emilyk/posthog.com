I'm going to start with a definition.

Organizational debt is the cost of future changes required when choosing an easy but short term solution, instead of a better long term approach that is harder to implement.

Here are all the areas we've chosen

## Not paying with a system

Every time you hire someone, there is a moment where you have a choice - how much money do we offer?

The first mentality that can cause issues is "I need to offer enough to get this particular person fairly comfortably". The candidate is excited to join your company, you aim to give them a bit of a bump over what they were earning before. You send the offer letter, they accept. You think you're done, but then it starts to unwind. Here's the cycle of doom - a year later, you've hired 2 more people, both of whom it turned out needed less pay for you to land them comfortably, and they're outperforming the first person. People talk and figure this out. Your strongest performers get frustrated. They raise it with you, you give them rises reactively. Now you're paying them more _and_ they're unhappy. Also, you've shown the organization that you'll respond to demands for pay rises. Everyone else starts asking for rises. You cant afford them. Everyone is unhappy.

Yeesh.

What does the solution look like:

Have a system for paying people. Stick to it. If you repeatedly can't make hires because of your system, adjust your system not the individual offers.

## Putting in processes

Something breaks. You put in a process that means it can't break again. Something else breaks, another process gets introduced, and so on. A year later no one can get anything done any more.

Perhaps this makes sense if you want to cruise in a big enterprise. However, startups are in the business of taking risks.

At PostHog, the solution is to focus on trust and feedback over process, _and_ to hire people that can work well with a lot of autonomy. It means hiring people with a little more experience in most cases.

## Hiring under pressure

## Not giving direct feedback

## Not writing things down

It feels like work, but is exactly how to reduce future work much more.

## Not sharing information

Sometimes businesses do well, other times they do badly. It might feel easier to just not talk about things that aren't going well.

Sure, that'll save time, but long term - oh no.

## Not having direct conversations and not letting people go that aren't a good fit

These are some of the toughest parts of running a startup. However, they're some of the most critical.
