One of my greatest weeks at PostHog was an offsite in Aruba. As much as I love a Caribbean paradise, it wasn't for the reason you expect.

In 2023, we were having a great year in the face of most of [tech struggling](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/tech-recession-layoffs-google-facebook-microsoft/672798/), and we wanted something to celebrate. We knew there wouldn't be any big external milestones - like a fundraise for example - to break up the year, and we had a _ton_ of stuff we expected our team to build. We therefore wanted to have a bit of a celebration of how things were going. So we increased the offsite budget, went for a fairly fancy hotel in the Caribbean.

As fun as that sounds - a core part of my job is making sure we don't run out of money. Alas.

We turned up and I felt a little *guilty*. The lobby had a _boat_ in it, there was a _private beach_, you could drink _infinite pi√±a coladas_. Add those up, and I knew we were spending $100K more than we _needed_ to.

As any right-minded founder would:

1. I compartmentalized my feelings
2. I kept refreshing our revenue dashboard

Our growth had been really consistently increasing each month, and it turned out that the month of our offsite was no exception. Within ~2 days we'd increased our annual recurring revenue enough to pay for the _entire_ trip. 

The reason this made me feel so pleased was it demonstrated the efficiency of our business model - we can literally be relaxing on a beach and making money whilst not working. Passive income baby! The reason this happens is that PostHog is a 100% inbound company - we've consistently put useful and cool stuff online (like our products or our content), and because we've done a remarkable-enough job of those things, we now just need to keep building on these to grow through word of mouth. It means we don't need people constantly cold emailing or calling to find more business.

If you fast forward today, 900 companies a week now sign up to PostHog, from hobbyists to Fortune 500s.

## Prerequisites

* If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. You are going to have to handle a literally-endless series of problems. Find a friend! 
* The ability to ship websites and products very fast. If you're doing software, you must be very, very good at shipping and marketing software quickly. Some people seem to be able to do this naturally, I wound up working for other software companies for a few years first.

## Getting to 10 users - does the product actually function

This was the hardest part.

For every stage of a startup, the earlier you are, the higher the chance of failure. With this in mind, you must be totally geared around failing fast. Hence the prerequisites above.

So, we set off doing this... We wound up pivoting (ie failing) five times before we landed on PostHog. We met the prerequisites!

For PostHog specifically, we wanted to quickly figure out if anyone cared.

To test this, we had a plan, that was designed to take one month:
1. we got friends up and running first
1. see if people can get up and running by themselves
1. then do a bigger launch - hacker news

There were a lot of things we did to make this possible
* open source (we started with Heroku one click deployment but later realized this was a mistake, I'd have had a cloud product to start with next time)
  * we picked a permissive license - we didnd't want to stop enterprises adopting and felt we'd still be able to make money / why weren't worried about competitors
* we had trust we wouldn't need to focus on revenue - but this doesn't apply universally
* build trust
* pricing gets out the way

To get our first 10 users, I asked my friends.

To find your friends that might be relevant:

* whoever springs to mind first
* go through your whatsapp / texts
* go through your linkedin, searching for people who are your first degree connections
* go through your linkedin, looking for people who've ever worked at the same places you've worked

You are unlikely to be self serve at this stage - if you are being very fast, you probably don't have the ability to create a new user without manually editing the database.

## Getting to 50 users - can people self serve (if doing product led growth) and does anyone care

Righty, so your app works - people can log in and use it.

Now you need to figure out if someone who _doesn't know you_ cares enough to use it, and if they 

## Getting to 100 users - figure out what is driving people to use it

We asked people why they signed up. It's important you don't pre-fill their responses.
We did a little marketing. We just tried to be helpful on the internet and to write about things we really understood. This worked.


## Getting to 1,000 users - do more of what is working, and clarify your ICP



## Bonus: Getting to 100,000 users - scale the business to match your demand

* Added a few people into marketing
* Fundraised and added engineers + a small ops team
  * it'd have been possible to skip this step
* When we hired a support person
* We added a growth team that help us with our activation, billing and growth experiments
