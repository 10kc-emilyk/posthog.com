One of my greatest weeks at PostHog was an offsite in Aruba. As much as I love a Caribbean paradise, it wasn't for the reason you expect.

In 2023, we were having a great year in the face of most of [tech struggling](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/tech-recession-layoffs-google-facebook-microsoft/672798/), and we wanted something to celebrate. We knew there wouldn't be any big external milestones - like a fundraise for example - to break up the year, and we had a _ton_ of stuff we expected our team to build. We therefore wanted to have a bit of a celebration of how things were going. So we increased the offsite budget, went for a fairly fancy hotel in the Caribbean.

As fun as that sounds - a core part of my job is making sure we don't run out of money. Alas.

We turned up and I felt a little *guilty*. The lobby had a _boat_ in it, there was a _private beach_, you could drink _infinite pi√±a coladas_. Add those up, and I knew we were spending $100K more than we _needed_ to.

As any right-minded founder would:

1. I compartmentalized my feelings
2. I kept refreshing our revenue dashboard

Our growth had been really consistently increasing each month, and it turned out that the month of our offsite was no exception. Within ~2 days we'd increased our annual recurring revenue enough to pay for the _entire_ trip. 

The reason this made me feel so pleased was it demonstrated the efficiency of our business model - we can literally be relaxing on a beach and making money whilst not working. Passive income baby! The reason this happens is that PostHog is a 100% inbound company - we've consistently put useful and cool stuff online (like our products or our content), and because we've done a remarkable-enough job of those things, we now just need to keep building on these to grow through word of mouth. It means we don't need people constantly cold emailing or calling to find more business.

If you fast forward today, 900 companies a week now sign up to PostHog, from hobbyists to Fortune 500s.

## Prerequisites

* If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. You are going to have to handle a literally-endless series of problems. Find a friend! 
* The ability to ship websites and products very fast. If you're doing software, you must be very, very good at shipping and marketing software quickly. Some people seem to be able to do this naturally, I wound up working for other software companies for a few years first.


## Getting to 10 users - does anyone care

This was the hardest part.

* Pivots


To test this, we went through these steps
* get friends up and running first
* see if people can get up and running by themselves
* then do a bigger launch - hacker news

There were a lot of things we did to make this possible
* open source (we started with Heroku one click deployment but later realized this was a mistake, I'd have had a cloud product to start with next time)
  * we picked a permissive license - we didnd't want to stop enterprises adopting and felt we'd still be able to make money / why weren't worried about competitors
* we had trust we wouldn't need to focus on revenue - but this doesn't apply universally
* build trust
* pricing gets out the way


## Getting to 50 users - can you get people you don't know, to use it


## Getting to 100 users - figure out what is driving people to use it

We asked people why they signed up. It's important you don't pre-fill their responses.
We did a little marketing. We just tried to be helpful on the internet and to write about things we really understood. This worked.


## Getting to 1,000 users - do more of what is working, and clarify your ICP



## Bonus: Getting to 100,000 users - scale the business to match your demand

* Added a few people into marketing
* Fundraised and added engineers + a small ops team
  * it'd have been possible to skip this step
* When we hired a support person
* We added a growth team that help us with our activation, billing and growth experiments
