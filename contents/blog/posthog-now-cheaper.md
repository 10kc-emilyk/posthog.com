We grow a _lot_ through word of mouth - roughly 60% of our growth comes through recommendation. Every now and again, we've dug into _why_ people recommend us.

The top four responses we get are:

1. All the tools I need in one
2. Open source
3. Support
4. Price

My reaction varies with each of these reasons. Whilst 1 and 2 are exactly what we'd hope for, 3 is a nice thing to say, 4 I would try to squint and not see. People are using us because it's _cheap_? Do they not value the product much? _How dare they?!_

There is a _lot_ written about this. The tl;dr is that cheap customers are seen as the worst - they pay less _and_ are less happy as they don't value your service.

So, we should raise prices right?

We decided to do the opposite. ***PostHog is getting a lot cheaper.***

## Get in first

There are two buckets of reasons why someone might not want to spend much:

* no value / urgency / reason to move forward
* no money

Our general strategy is to get in ahead of our competitors who are mainly pushing upmarket. We believe that many of our users value the service _and_ don't have much money.

## Why serving those without much money to spend is valuable

Anytime in marketing you can directly measure the impact of your work, you are going to get competition - which means the results will be underwhelming.

It's a lot easier to get in front of users that no one else cares about. And we get in front of a lot - we're now signing up 600 to 700 companies a week, all inbound, and nearly all through word of mouth.

The magic then is having some mechanism to make money despite many of our users not having it. Simplistically, people talk and when we have more free users, we get more paid users. And word of mouth from happy users is a wonderful way to reach them. Or, put more pithfully, the more we give away for free, the more money we make.

Yes, this is scary - we can't really measure this 100% accurately. But we know it's working, and the difficulty in measuring this is why it works since it makes it unappealing for others to do the same.

## So, what happened to your revenue then?

When we've made price changes historically, we've tried to avoid rolling them to the existing user base - since this means a lot of communication overhead, potential confusion and churn, and it just slows us down.

However, in this case we felt since we decided to reduce prices, we needed to make the change for existing users as well. Having cheaper products for new users wouldn't be a good look!

We price in tiers:

* the first tier (1M to 2M events/month) is now 32% cheaper
* the second tier (2M to 10M events/month) is 43% cheaper
