# Retention is your most important metric

## What is customer retention analytics?

It's about understanding whether your customers keep coming back to use your product or they stop getting value from it and churn. A healthy product will have a high retention with users regularly coming back again and again.

There are two key metrics used in retention analytics, but they're very similar:

**Retention Rate:** % of customers still using the product at the end of the period

**Churn Rate:** % of customers lost by the end of the period

## Why does retention matter?

If your retention is bad, no matter how much you spend on advertising or how many new users or you sign up - you will struggle to grow. Since the people who are joining are just leaving.

Many growing businesses focus only on sign-ups, because getting 1,000 new users sounds like progress, but if you lose 90% of them through churn, you only have 100 at the end of the month. If you acquired half the number of users but managed to retain 90% you'll end up with 450 users at the end of the month.

## What does good retention look like?

A good benchmark for retention rate of a SaaS product is around 95 - 98% per month, >99% is considered excellent. However retention rates will differ based on the nature of your product and the size of your customers.

You would expect much higher retention rates for businesses paying >$100K/yr  than you would for businesses spending <$100.

However, for consumer facing and free products, retention rates of around 30% are considered a good benchmark.

## Understanding cohort retention?

You can look at your retention for all users, but as you make improvements to you product and marketing you want to understand if they're improving your retention. To do this you break down your retention by cohorts, each cohort is the group of users which activated within a certain time period (e.g. one week).

You then look at then look at how this cohort retains over time, this means as you launch new ways to improve your product you can see retention for more your latest cohorts improving or getting worse

## Customer Retention Strategies

To increase customer retention there are three main activities to invest in:

- **Improving activation:** Leverage funnels to understand where people are dropping off after they sign up, do they get to the key feature of your product before they leave, user guides and nudges can be really helpful to help users get activated successfully
- **Creating more value for customers:** Building new features that your customers need and love will create more value for them and will drive them to return and use the product again in the future
- **Reengagement:** Users who like your product can sometimes be distracted by other things, well worded and well timed re-engagement such as "you left these items in your basket" can be extremely powerful in bringing customers back to your product and improving retention
