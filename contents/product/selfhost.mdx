        <h5>Compliance, made easy</h5>
        <p>
            Self-hosting makes it easier to comply with regulations such as HIPPA and GDPR, as PII never leaves your servers. Even we don’t have access.

        <h5>Capture up to 30% more data</h5>
        <p>Self-hosting removes the need for third-party cookies, so ad blockers and privacy settings don’t get in the way. Understand more users, better.</p>

        <h5>Stay in control of your instance</h5>
        <p>Self-hosting gives you complete control over everything, from which servers you use to when PostHog updates happen. No surprises.</p>
