### What does the LaunchDarkly Connector do?
This app exports actions — such as toggling a feature flag —  from LaunchDarkly and into PostHog via the API. This is useful for analyzing LaunchDarkly events using PostHog's product analytics suite and alongside other product data.

###### What are the requirements for this app?
Using the LaunchDarkly connector requires either PostHog Cloud, or a self-hosted PostHog instance running [version 1.30.0](https://posthog.com/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0) or later. 

Not running 1.30.0? Find out [how to update your self-hosted PostHog deployment](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog)!

You'll also need a LaunchDarkly account, obviously.
