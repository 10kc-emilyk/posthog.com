A growth loop is a type of viral growth; a successful growth loop means that most of your new users come directly from existing users.

This tutorial explains the products that are well-suited to this approach, then gives examples on how to measure growth loops.

## Pre-requisites

There are four growth engines that you can focus on - make sure that growth loops (virality) is a natural fit for your product:

* Virality is a natural fit if:
  * _Multiplayer product_: Your product is enhanced (or only works) when you've friends and colleagues using it (e.g. Snapchat, Figma, Zoom)
  * _Fun-to-share product_: Your product is fun to share (e.g. TikTok, Instagram, Airbnb listings)
* Performance Marketing is a natural fit if:
  * Customers won't naturally be looking for your product (e.g. Allbirds)
  * You make revenue from new users, to fund more marketing (e.g. subscriptions/purchases)
* Content is a natural fit if:
  * Your users generate shareable content via your product (e.g. Stackoverflow)
  * You've a large amount of data generated by your product to autogenerate pages (e.g. Tripadvisor)
* Sales is a natural fit i:
  * Your users require a lot of support to get value from your product
  * Customers have high average lifetime value

## Tracking a multiplayer product growth loop

Here's an example:

1. Your company recruits User 1 at Company 1.
1. User 1 recruits User 2. User 2 recruits User 3... etc.
1. Some of the Users tell their friends. They invite User 1 at Company 2.

### Multiplayer product loop required event taxonomy

In this example, the following Events are needed:

* User signed up (setting a Group for the User's company)
* User activated
* User referred a new user

### Multiplayer product loop dashboard items

Relevant [Trends](../user-guides/trends):

* Users signed up (total)
  * External users signed up
  * Internal users signed up
* Users activated
  * External users activated
  * Internal users activated
* Referred users (total)
  * Internal referred users
  * External referred users

Relevant [Funnels](../user-guides/funnels):

* User sign up conversion rate
* User activation rate
* Average number of users per company
* Average number of internal referrals per activated user (some overlap with average number of users per company)
* Average number of external referrals per activated user

## Tracking a fun-to-share product growth loop

Here's an example:

1. Your company recruits User 1.
1. User 1 generates content.
1. User 2 sees content and signs up. User 2 generates content. User 2 sees content and signs up... etc.

### Fun-to-share loop required event taxonomy

In this example, the following Events are needed:

* User sign up
  * Important - you will either need to make sure you're capturing the referrer details (our JS library does this by default), or that you have a referral mechanism you can control
* User activates
* User generates content
* User shares content (if possible)

### Fun-to-share loop dashboard items

Relevant [Trends](../user-guides/trends):

* Users signed up (total)
  * Users signed up (breakdown by initial referrer / referrer)
* Users activated
* Volume of content created
* Volume of content shared
  * This may be challenging to do technically, depending on the nature of how your product enables sharing.
* Referred users
  * Either through users signed up filtered on a specific referrer, through a direct referral mechanism inside the product, _or_ by asking users when they sign up
  
Relevant [Funnels](../user-guides/funnels):

* User sign up conversion rate
* User activation rate
* Average number of pieces of content created per activated user
* Average number of pieces of content shared per piece of content created (if possible)
* Average number of referred users per piece of content shared (if possible)
