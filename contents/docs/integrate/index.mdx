After setting up your PostHog instance, the next step is to begin sending events from your app or website. PostHog acts as a catch-all destination for events from across your entire product.
PostHog provides a number of ways to start ingesting events:

1. Installing our snippet
2. Using client or server libraries
3. Our API
4. Third-party apps

## Getting started

There are a number of ways to get started with integrating PostHog. Each of these methods provides a bit of info on how to get started, as well as some of the considerations when picking how you will bring events into PostHog.

### Snippet

This is the fastest way to get started with PostHog on the web and will automatically capture events when users view your website.
You can also use the [toolbar](/docs/user-guides/toolbar) to set up custom events for when users perform certain actions.

Typically, the snippet installation makes the most sense for non-technical users or for getting things up and running quick. If you want more detail on exactly what your users are doing, as well as if you have a website that you anticipate will change it's layout frequently, we would recommend using one of our [client](#client-libraries) or [server](#server) libraries.

```html
<script>
    !function(t,e){var o,n,p,r;e.__SV||(window.posthog=e,e._i=[],e.init=function(i,s,a){function g(t,e){var o=e.split(".");2==o.length&&(t=t[o[0]],e=o[1]),t[e]=function(){t.push([e].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments,0)))}}(p=t.createElement("script")).type="text/javascript",p.async=!0,p.src=s.api_host+"/static/array.js",(r=t.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]).parentNode.insertBefore(p,r);var u=e;for(void 0!==a?u=e[a]=[]:a="posthog",u.people=u.people||[],u.toString=function(t){var e="posthog";return"posthog"!==a&&(e+="."+a),t||(e+=" (stub)"),e},u.people.toString=function(){return u.toString(1)+".people (stub)"},o="capture identify alias people.set people.set_once set_config register register_once unregister opt_out_capturing has_opted_out_capturing opt_in_capturing reset isFeatureEnabled onFeatureFlags".split(" "),n=0;n<o.length;n++)g(u,o[n]);e._i.push([i,s,a])},e.__SV=1)}(document,window.posthog||[]);
    posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>', {api_host: '<ph_instance_address>'})
</script>
```

Place this snippet in the `<head>` tags of your website, ideally just above the closing `</head>` tag. You will need to do this for all pages that you wish to track.

For more information read the [snippet installation guide](/docs/integrate/snippet-installation).

### Client libraries

Below is a list of all of our standalone libraries for capturing events from your app or website with PostHog.

### Server libraries

### API

One of the most powerful features of PostHog is the ability to ingest events directly via our `Events` API.

If you're looking to bring data in from a third party service, there may already be an [app](#apps) for that!

### Apps

Apps extend PostHog's functionality and are an incredibly powerful part of the PostHog ecosystem. They can help you:

-   Bring data in from 3rd party services
-   Enrich events in your pipeline by adding extra data
-   Filter events to keep your data clean
-   Much, much more...

Below is a list of all apps for bringing data into PostHog. For a list of all our apps, see [here](/apps)
