If you don't want to or aren't able to use PostHog Cloud, but still want scalability, premium features, upgrades, and support, PostHog Virtual Private Cloud might be the solution.

With a Virtual Private Cloud, we'll host a fully-featured instance of PostHog on your own AWS/Azure/GCS account. This means you have full control over and access to the underlying data, but you don't have to worry about maintance, stability and upgrades.

## Getting started

To get started with a PostHog Virtual Private Cloud, please contact [sales@posthog.com](mailto:sales@posthog.com).
