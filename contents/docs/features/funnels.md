If you need your users to carry out a series of actions in a row, funnels are a way of working out where users are dropping off.

There are many valuable use cases for this data:

* If you need users to sign up and then perform a key action, you can easily analyze the percentage that are dropping out.
* If you need users to come back repeatedly to perform an action, you can see how many “first time” users return.
* If you are trying to understand where in your marketing funnel that you are getting drop off, funnel analytics will make clear what you need to focus on to grow.
 
A funnel is a series of Actions.

You can watch a two-minute training video on Funnels here:

## Creating a Funnel

To create a funnel, go to ‘Funnels’ in the left hand navigation:

![left hand navigation - funnels selected](../../images/04/Posthog-11.png)
<br>

You’ll be taken to a page showing statistics on any existing funnels you have built, Click ‘New funnel’ to begin:

<br>

### Adding actions or events

Next, create the first in the series of Actions or Events:

<br>

Add more Actions or Events as needed:

<br>

You'll end up with a graph - something like this:

<br>

The above image demonstrates that whilst there were 11 ‘Sign up’s, there was just one ‘Apply for Beta clicked’.
<br>

### Filter Funnels by Time

You can also filter funnels by time intervals. By default, funnels will show actions completed over the last 7 days, but this can be changed by selecting the time interval next to 'Add to dashboard'

## Funnel Drop-off User Breakdown

We can go even further with PostHog – to see which users were in this funnel, and how each of them behaved:

From here, it’s easy to click an individual user, to see their entire Events history – all you have to do is click the provided link.
