## Accessing Retention Table

1. Click 'Users' on the sidebar to reveal a dropdown menu.
2. Click 'Retention'

## Uses

The Retention table is useful to determine if your users are indeed coming back to your website, and what percentage of them come back as the days pass. If your retention is too low, you may want to reconsider some design decisions. 

This pairs up nicely with [Trend Stickiness](/docs/features/trends), so you can determine what trends may be influencing your retention in a good or bad way.
