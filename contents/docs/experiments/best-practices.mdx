## 1. Only include affected users

Including users who aren't affected by the experiment can lead to unreliable results. For example, if you're testing a new onboarding flow, you don't want to include users who have already completed the flow.

To avoid including unaffected users, make sure to first filter out ineligible users in your code before checking your feature flag code. For example:

```js
// ✅ Correct. Will exclude unaffected users
function showNewChanges(user) {

  if (user.hasCompletedAction) {
    return false
  }

  // other checks

  if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-key') === 'control') {
    return false;
  }

  return true
}

// ❌ Incorrect. Will include unaffected users
function showNewChanges(user) {
  if (posthog.getFeatureFlag('experiment-key') === 'control') {
    return false;
  }

  if (user.hasCompletedAction) {
    return false
  }

  // other checks

  return true
}
```

## 2. Test your experiment

Sometimes we're so eager to get results from our experiments, we jump straight to running them with all our users. This is okay if everything is set up correctly, but if you've made a mistake, you may be unable to rerun your experiment. To understand why, let's look at an example:

Imagine you're running an experiment with a 50/50 split between control and test. You roll out the experiment to all your users, but a day after launch, you notice that your change is causing the app to crash for all test users. You immediately stop the experiment and fix the root cause of the crash. However, restarting the experiment now will produce unreliable results since many users have already seen your change.

To avoid this problem, you should first test your experiment with a [small rollout](/tutorials/phased-rollout) (e.g., 5% of users) for a few days. Once you're confident everything works correctly, you can start the experiment with the remaining users.

Here is a list of what to check during your test rollout:
- Logging is working correctly
- No increase in crashes or other errors
- Use [session replays](/session-replay) to ensure your app is behaving as expected
- Users are assigned to the control and test groups in the ratio you are expecting (e.g., 50/50).


## 3. Establish a clear hypothesis

A good hypothesis focuses your testing and guides your decision-making. It should include your goal metric, how you think your change will improve it, and any other important context. For example:

> Showing a short tutorial video during onboarding will help users understand how to use our product. As a result, we expect to see more successful interactions with the app, fewer customer support queries, and reduced churn (our primary goal) among tested users.

This is a good hypothesis because it enables you to break down which metrics you'll focus on in your test:

- How many users watch the video
- What portion of the video they viewed
- Successful interactions with the app features
- The number of customer support queries
- Churn rate

Then, once you've collected data with your test, you can use these metrics to analyze if your test was a success or not.

## 4. Predetermine your test duration

Starting an experiment without deciding how long it should last can cause you to fall victim to the [peeking problem](/product-engineers/ab-testing-mistakes#3-conducting-an-experiment-without-a-predetermined-duration/). This is when you check the intermediate results for statistical significance, make decisions based on them, and end your experiment too early. Without determining how long your experiment should run, you cannot differentiate between intermediate and final results.

Alternatively, if you don't have enough statistical power (i.e., not enough users to obtain a significant result), you'll potentially waste weeks waiting for results. This is especially common in [group-targeted experiments](/blog/running-group-targeted-ab-tests).

For these reasons, PostHog includes a recommended running time calculator in the experiment setup flow. This calculates the minimum sample size required to run your experiment and the duration you should run your experiment for.

## 5. Use a launch checklist

Launching an A/B test requires careful planning to ensure accurate results and meaningful insights. To help you navigate this, we've put together this launch checklist:
```
**Before launch**

- [ ] A clear goal metric.
- [ ] A clear hypothesis.
- [ ] Secondary metrics.
- [ ] Counter metrics.
- [ ] Predefined test duration, based on sample size.
- [ ] Code only includes eligible users that will be affected by change.
- [ ] QA checks on both control and test variants.

**24-48 hours after launch:**

- [ ] Volume of users assigned to each variant is as expected.
- [ ] All logging is working correctly and in correct ratios.
- [ ] No increase in crashes or errors.

**At the end of the test duration**

- [ ] Validate or invalidate your hypothesis based on experiment data.
- [ ] Document your results and share with your team for feedback.
- [ ] Ship winning variant code. Delete code for losing variant.
