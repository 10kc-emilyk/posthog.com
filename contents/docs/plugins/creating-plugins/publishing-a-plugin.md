Hoorah - your plugin is working. Now it's time to [get famous](https://www.wikihow.com/Become-Famous).

1. Submit a PR to edit the [plugin directory JSON](https://github.com/PostHog/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json).
1. When edits to the JSOn get merged, the core team will manually add the plugin to teh docs. We'll automate this one day!

## Cool merch

We give some [cool merch](https://merch.posthog.com) out to plugin authors. We'll reach out when we see the PR appear.

If we've missed you out here, email hey@posthog.com!
