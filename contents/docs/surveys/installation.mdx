Surveys are a great tool to collect qualitative feedback from your users.

To get started with surveys, add PostHog to your web app by installing our **JavaScript snippet** or **`posthog-js` library**:

> **Important:** When installing PostHog via a package manager, surveys require `posthog-js v1.67+`.

import WebInstall from '../integrate/_snippets/install-web.mdx'
