title: PostHog telemetry
---

PostHog tracks some usage of its own products. You can opt out of any telemetry at any time.

## Self-hosting (Open source / Self-serve / Enterprise)

This is designed for individual or smaller teams of developers to use for non-commercial or smaller commercial projects.

The repo can be found at the PostHog GitHub.

We ask users if they wish to opt in to:

-   Our Slack channel where we have a community
-   Email newsletter
-   Email security updates

We provide opt-out tracking on some basic high-level information on the product:

-   Aggregated usage data
-   The entity who initially uses the software:
-   Email address if provided
-   Company name if provided
-   The host

### PostHog Cloud

We track product usage with our own product – the same you will be using – by default. However, you can choose to opt-out of tracking we can opt you out – if you are an existing or prospective customer, talk to us about it.
