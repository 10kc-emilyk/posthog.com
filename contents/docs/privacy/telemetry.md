title: PostHog telemetry
---

PostHog tracks some usage of its own products. You can opt out of any telemetry at any time.

## Self-hosting (Open source / Self-serve / Enterprise)

We ask users if they wish to opt in to:

-   Our Slack channel where we have a community
-   Email newsletter
-   Email security updates

We provide opt-out tracking on some basic high-level information on the product:

-   Aggregated usage data
-   The entity who initially uses the software:
-   Email address if provided
-   Company name if provided
-   The host

## PostHog Cloud

We track product usage with our own product – the same you will be using – by default.
This includes information on how our users utilize our product, which helps us ship and improve features.

## Anonymizing or opting-out of tracking

If you wish to anonymize your data, you can do so any time by visiting your personal settings, and choosing to 'Anonymize Data Collection'.
We will continue to track events about your usage, but we will no longer associate them with your account's email.

If instead you would like to opt-out of all tracking - whether you're an existing or prospective customer - please email us at hey@posthog.com.
