PostHog includes tools for creating your own referral program, so you can offer users rewards in return for sharing your product. We use it to power our own referral program, the PostHog Pyramid Scheme. 

We built our referral program and the tools you need to create your own during a hackathon at our 2024 company offsite in Mykonos.
