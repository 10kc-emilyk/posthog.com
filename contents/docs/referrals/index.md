PostHog includes tools for creating your own referral program, so you can offer users rewards in return for sharing your product. We use it to power our own referral program, the PostHog Pyramid Scheme.

## Customizing your referral program

## Best practices and further resources
We originally built our referral program tools during a hackathon at our 2024 company offsite so we could use them to create our own referral program. Here are some of the best practices we decided to implement in our own program and which we recommend: 

- Choose a conversion event which is at least as valuable to you as the reward you offer. Sign-ups are an obvious candidate, but may not be suitable if your product has a free tier. 
- Choose a reward which users will be genuinely interested in as individuals. This is especially important for B2B products: Platform credit isn't very attractive to individuals in a large organization. 
- Track the success of your referral program closely using [product analytics](/docs/product-analytics). Keep an eye on who your biggest referrers are and iterate your program based on what makes them successful.
