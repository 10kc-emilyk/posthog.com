## TL;DR

Our mission is to “Increase the number of successful products in the world”.

We started by building an open-source product analytics platform with all the basic things you'd need to understand user behavior - funnels, trends, session recording, feature flags and many more features. Within a year we had thousands of customers using us and we started generating revenue.

We focused on PostHog Scale (our first self-hosted paid product) earlier this year. We quickly hit a milestone for the first 5 reference customers, and we've kept selling since - exclusively focussing on inbound organic demand. We've had best in class net revenue retention from these customers and our PostHog Cloud users.

The next step on our journey is to figure out how to accelerate our top of funnel growth, whilst achieving larger order values from our Enterprise product.

### Context

We’ve grown a lot (10s of thousands of sign ups), but it’s clear that the many of our users use us *despite* a bad experience - complex deployment and maintenance, in particular. This is a great problem to have. It means we’re solving a hair on fire problem - product analytics that you can self host.

Whilst PostHog's adoption is driven by one developer through our open source product, we're seeing those deployments converting steadily into paying relationships with PostHog Scale.

We're aiming to keep expanding this adoption within the largest organizations using PostHog, whilst scaling our community growth.

### Mission

**_“Increase the number of successful products in the world”_**

### Long-term vision (for 2026)

**_“PostHog IPOs, becoming a standard tool for building a more successful product without losing control of user data”_**

An IPO is a specific outcome that strongly signals we've become a standard tool.

We will need to have approximately $100M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This is likely to mean 300 customers over $100K ARR and 20 customers over $1M ARR. 

To get there, engineers in any size organization can install PostHog and within a few hours, qualitative and quantitative data will be captured from their product, audience and any other data sources they have (playing nicely with data warehouses).

PostHog will surface this data at the right time to anyone involved in building the product (PMs, Engineers, Customer Success, Support) to make their own well-informed decisions and safely release changes, validate and realize the opportunities identified.

### Target audience (for 2021)

Our customers are a combination of users, businesses and the products themselves. In order to understand where we should focus our efforts, below is a proposed breakdown of our target audience based on attributes of a product. 

* Needs
  * Need to control their user data
  * Need to excel at product led 
* Haves
  * Have budget and savvy engineers are the decision makers
  * Have achieved product market fit
  * Have a central analytics function
  * Have deployed our open source product successfully
