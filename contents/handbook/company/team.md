We are proud to be misfits. Why?

Building an unusually great company starts with an unusual team.

We don't care if you haven't finished (or attended) school, if you were super important at FANG Corp or if you ran a startup that crashed and burned.

What we do care about is your ability to learn, iterate and ship.

That's why we have people from Belgium, Brazil, Connecticut, England, Estonia, the Netherlands, Senegal, San Francisco, amongst others.

## James Hawkins, Co-Founder and CEO

I spent the first 10 years of my career trying to be a professional cyclist. I used to do web development part time to make some money on the side. I wasn't particularly good at either.

I live in Cambridge with Fran (wife), Ruby (daughter), and Wally (cat). Since you're probably wondering, the cat's name is a reference to [WALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E) - work for us to find out why.

After a growing sense of my own mortality combined with a bunch of large crashes put me off continuing with my cycling career, I bootstrapped an online marketing company to several million dollars a year.

I wanted more experience of working in a VC backed startup, so I could work on something really ambitious. I moved to [Arachnys](https://arachnys.com), and somehow wound up as a their VP of Sales for a little over 4 years, where I used to manage a team selling very large enterprise software deals. We learned how to take our sales from an average of $5K/year to over $1M/year.

I started working with Tim on a few ideas that didn't work out in August 2019. We built PostHog during the YCombinator W20 batch, and launched in February. You can work out what I've been up to since by stalking me online.

## Tim Glaser, Co-Founder and CTO

Tim has been coding for cash since he was 11, and full time since he was 16!

Tim met James at Arachnys where he was responsible for Research and Development.

Fun fact: Tim is actually Dutch, despite sounding British.

## Marius Andra, Software Engineer

Marius released an analytics library on Hacker News a few weeks before PostHog launched. The very first recruiting email from PostHog went to him, and he said yes!

Marius is incredibly fast and holds the PostHog world record for the number of languages used in a week. He also runs [Kea](https://github.com/keajs/kea), which is used by PostHog for React state management.

## Eric Duong, Software Engineer

Eric is a former entrepreneur and organized massive scale community cooking sessions, and recently graduated in mathematics from [Yale](https://yale.edu).

We were so impressed by how proactive he is, and the quality of the design of [his previous startup](https://magical.app), that we couldn't help ourselves but get him on board!
