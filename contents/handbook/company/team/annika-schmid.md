## Areas of focus

I primarily work with the [Feature Success](/handbook/small-teams/feature-success) and [Monitoring](/handbook/small-teams/monitoring) teams.

I have written up how I think I can have the highest impact in my role in Q2 2023 and beyond. Let me know if I can be helpful in any other way.

**How does my best work look like in Q2:**

- We have a continuous interview process, where we speak to a couple of users a week. I am managing the interviews, having the team members join and co-lead the session with questions relevant to what they are working on.
- Through user research and industry research, I surface the biggest problem areas relevant to the teams and products I am working with, and collect all the relevant background research so that the teams can confidently prioritise and implement solutions. As required, I support the team with prioritisation and designing the right solution for the problem.
- Because of my background in design, I can, if required, lead or co-lead designing new features, for example through conduction ideation sessions, wireframing concepts in Figma, and conducting usability tests. Every engineer has a different preference here, so I work closely with the feature owner to get to the desired outcome. I also ensure that our existing products stay usable and make sure we balance new feature development with iterating on existing features to increase their usage and usability.
- The small teams own the features they are working on, and facilitate design/product decision making. I am there to consult, share best practices and give feedback, but I am not the driving force. Together with the team lead I am responsible that this happens.
- Everyone in the team can show the outcomes their work had in terms of happy users, growing usage numbers (and revenue). Together with the team lead I am responsible that this happens.
- I am the driving force behind positioning new products and having a pricing strategy for the teams I work with. I coordinate the product, growth and marketing teams to make sure we do the required work here and donâ€™t drop the ball.
- I support the exec team with product strategy and planning for the months and years ahead. I research potential new products we can add to PostHog and continuously speak to existing and potential ICP users to identify their behaviours and needs when developing products. I have a strong opinion loosely held of what we should build next, in particular for the teams I work with.
