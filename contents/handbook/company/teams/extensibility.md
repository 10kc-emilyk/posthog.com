## Mission

Team Extensibility's job is to take care of the PostHog platform. What does that mean?

We're not called "Team Platform" because "platform" is an ambiguous term. We're not responsible for the entire PostHog 
platform (aka universe), the one you see when you look at the "features" page and see "this is the platform that we 
offer: analytics, session, etc".

No, it's the "platform" in the "Plugins turn PostHog into a platform... that everyone can integrate with" that rests on 
our shoulders.

## Responsibilities

Team Extensibility is responsible for:

- Maintaining and improving the plugin server 
- Maintaining and improving the ingestion pipeline
- Maintaining and improving all the integrations to other platforms

## Priorities

- Priority nr 1: making sure there are no cracks in the walls and that we always keep in mind safety, security, and data 
  integrity of our systems. We code defensively, prefer allowlists to denylists, always have at least 2 people review
  any piece of code, etc.
- Priority nr 2: an absolutely fabulous user experience. Connecting things to PostHog either via plugins or integrations
  should be a joy.

## Customer

TBD (can be both internal or external)

## Output metric

- Nr of plugins in active use
- Nr of plugins installed
- Used plugin-seconds on cloud, breakdown by team (for billing)
