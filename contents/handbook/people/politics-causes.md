At PostHog, the highest performing culture is an apolitical one. Politics are more important than work, and hence will distract us from it. We also want a diverse team for performance reasons. This means sometimes people will have different and strongly held political opinions.

We want to signal both internally and externally that we are a neutral at an organizational level so that all people feel safe and accepted at work. For example:
  - This means we will not support _as a company_ political or social causes no matter what our personal views are
  - For example, we don't enforce listing each person's preferred pronouns, but will leave it to individuals’ preferences

However, we demand that people respect each other - for example, we do not discriminate based on someone’s views and we use someone’s preferred pronouns.

We want people to do their best work at PostHog, and we encourage people to use time outside of work to support their causes. 

At the same time, we want you to be able to express yourself and feel safe doing so - you are free to discuss politics or social causes with your colleagues
  - Keep it optional - not everyone wants to do this at work
  - Keep it kind

Here are a few examples:

- INSERT SLACK EXAMPLE
- Some team members wish to put on an event to celebrate Pride. This is something that we encourage, including during working hours, but activities should be internally focused, strictly optional and kind-natured. For example, talks with people explaining their personal experiences / Pride-specific book reading clubs. We ask you exercise your own judgement as we would any other activity that helps bring people together, over how much time you spend here and how to get the most out of the time spent. For example, make things well organized, with a plan for the session (even if simple) and so on!
