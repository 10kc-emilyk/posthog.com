- Objective: Events are ingested and processed reliably, accurately, and quickly on all deployments
    - Key result:
        - End-to-end P95 time to ingest events is under 1m30s for "normal events" and 2m30s for "buffer events" (note: includes 60s error bars)
        - We ingest 99.999% of valid events
            - Limit dead letter queue usage
        - Ingestion on self-hosted deployments is horizontally scalable
    - Why?
        - For customers to trust our product they need to be confident in our ability to handle their volumes reliably 

- Objective: MVP for PostHog CDP (5 happy customers)
    - Key results:
        - Nail data exports
            - Guaranteed job execution (99.999% of jobs processed)
            - (Automated) testing framework for apps
        - CDP UX
            - Pipeline metrics
            - Destination apps event filtering
            - (Stretch) CDP-like UI
    - Why?
        - By removing the need for other CDPs, Posthog can save the customers money and potentially create a new revenue line. 

## Old roadmap

### 3-year

#### Scaffolding to support core PostHog features

- Events are ingested and visible in app within 5 seconds p99

#### Ingestion robustness

- Ingest events out of order
- No events left behind (99.99%)
- All events are correct (99.99%)
- The pipeline scales perfectly linearly and intercept is low (smallest instance runs on $5 node)

#### Extensibility

- Integrated delightful plugin developer experience (inside PostHog)
    - CI/CD
    - Testing
    - Synthetic data testing
- Majority of users are using PostHog for their ETL / reverse-ETL workloads 

### 6 months

#### Scaffolding to support core PostHog features

- Scalable to 1Bn Persons ðŸŽ‰
- Events are ingested and visible in app within 30 seconds p99

#### Ingestion robustness

- Ingestion monitoring and management
    - Runbooks, dashboards, and alerts in Grafana on cloud and on self hosted


#### Extensibility

- Easy to build a well tested plugin (DevEx)
    - Documentation
    - GitHub Template
        - Unit tests
        - Style
