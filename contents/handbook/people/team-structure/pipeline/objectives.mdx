- Objective: Develop Posthog CDP into a solution capable of replacing other CDPs for data-warehousing categories. Increase % of customers using ‚Äúdata out‚Äù apps from X to Y
    - Key result:
        - Make the most important data in and out apps work reliably
            - (Potentially) Consolidate into 1 repo
            - Opinionated way of writing tests (maybe end-to-end), structuring the apps
            - Separate out filters
        - Team to fill in
    - Ideas
        - CDP style UI
            - Why? To make the CDP product feel like a standalone product similar to other CDP solutions
        - Live view of data or event testing
    - Why?
        - By removing the need for other CDPs, Posthog can save the customers money and potentially create a new revenue line. 
        - Historically we‚Äôve fixed things iteratively. We want to consider this as a product.
- Objective: Improve the performance of these areas
    - Key results:
        - Re-write how we do historical exports
            - Able to cope with lots of volume
            - Resource limiting the apps
            - Why?
                - We promised it to our largest customer
        - (Proposed lower priority) Performance - improve ingestion performance
            - Why?
            - High volume customers e.g. a very large open source devtool customer couldn‚Äôt use our ingestion pipeline and so had to insert directly into clickhouse


## Old roadmap

### 3-year

#### Scaffolding to support core PostHog features

- Events are ingested and visible in app within 5 seconds p99

#### Ingestion robustness

- Ingest events out of order
- No events left behind (99.99%)
- All events are correct (99.99%)
- The pipeline scales perfectly linearly and intercept is low (smallest instance runs on $5 node)

#### Extensibility

- Integrated delightful plugin developer experience (inside PostHog)
    - CI/CD
    - Testing
    - Synthetic data testing
- Majority of users are using PostHog for their ETL / reverse-ETL workloads 

### 6 months

#### Scaffolding to support core PostHog features

- Scalable to 1Bn Persons üéâ
- Events are ingested and visible in app within 30 seconds p99

#### Ingestion robustness

- Ingestion monitoring and management
    - Runbooks, dashboards, and alerts in Grafana on cloud and on self hosted


#### Extensibility

- Easy to build a well tested plugin (DevEx)
    - Documentation
    - GitHub Template
        - Unit tests
        - Style
