- Objective: High uptime and increase the resilience/redundancy
    - Key results:
      - Migrate postgres out of heroku
      - Regular synthetic load testing on production
    - Why?
        - A lack of reliability will cause churn.
- Objective: Meet the compliance needs of 5 companies that we cannot meet today
    - Key result: EU Cloud is successfully managed
    - Key result: Progress made on SOC2
    - Why?
        - Not having these is blocking customers, who we can often uniquely satisfy.
