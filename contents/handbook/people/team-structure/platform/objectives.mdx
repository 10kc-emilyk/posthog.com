- Objective: High uptime and increase the resilience/redundancy
    - Key results:
        - Team to fill in
    - Why?
        - A lack of reliability will cause churn.
- Objective: Meet the compliance needs of 5 companies that we cannot meet today
    - Key result: EU Cloud is successfully managed
    - Key result: SOC2 completed and security audit
    - Why?
        - Not having these is blocking customers, who we can often uniquely satisfy.
    - (Potentially) Objective: Enable customers to install a production grade self hosted version of Posthog in under 10 minutes (requires the scale plan)
    - Key result: 
        - To be filled in by the team
    - Ideas:
        - Speak to mid-market and enterprise to understand whether this would help improve their deployment
        - Implementation ideas
            - E.g. User creates an IAM, gives the details to Posthog which then spins up the code
            - User runs terraform directly in their own cloud 
        - Potentially change this as the default setup method for self-hosted and discontinue hobby and the helm chart version
        - Need to confirm that this deployment method would work with enterprises: Airbus, ING
        - Deprecate the hobby deployment
    - Why?
        - Simpler install and consistent install across users will result in less support needed. By setting up all the self-hosted clients on the scale plan will drive more revenue.
