- Objective: Get 80% of active b2b customers to add their marketing website
  - Why? Increase # events coming in, which increases revenue. Our hypothesis is that marketing websites have 10-100x more events than applications.
- Objective: Implement most frequently requested features with 3+ happy companies for the feature launch
  - Key results:
    - Implement the following:
      - Multiple breakdowns
      - Cohort style queries (did x event x times), but within a query itself
      - Composite events: ‘Any event’, ‘New user’ (users first event), ‘top events’
      - User composition (ie pie chart where you can select properties)/
      - Superscale querying - Get 98% of each company’s insights P99 below an acceptable time (to be worked out by the team)
- Why?
  - Quality/parity with other product analytics tools. Delighting customers especially power users, will lead to word of mouth growth.
