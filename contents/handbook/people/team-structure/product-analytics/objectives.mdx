Input from the execs:

> - Objective: Get 80% of active b2b customers to add their marketing website
>   - Why? Increase # events coming in, which increases revenue. Our hypothesis is that marketing websites have 10-100x more events than applications.
> - Objective: Implement most frequently requested features with 3+ happy companies for the feature launch
>   - Key results:
>     - Implement the following:
>       - Multiple breakdowns
>       - Cohort style queries (did x event x times), but within a query itself
>       - Composite events: ‘Any event’, ‘New user’ (users first event), ‘top events’
>       - User composition (ie pie chart where you can select properties)/
>       - Superscale querying - Get 98% of each company’s insights P99 below an acceptable time (to be worked out by the team)
> - Why?
>   - Quality/parity with other product analytics tools. Delighting customers especially power users, will lead to word of mouth growth.



## Proposed Objective 1: Nail Data Exploration



## Proposed Objective 2: Nail Web Analytics
- Why? A lot of our customers are only using us to track their product, and not their marketing website.
  Our hypothesis is that marketing websites have 10-100x more events than applications.

- Analysis:
  - We are not seen as a web analytics company, and have previously worked to avoid that title.
  - There is a large overlap between web and product analytics. Our infrastructure can handle both usecases.
  - Google is sunsetting the traditional "google analytics" web analytics product ("universal analytics"), and moving
    everyone to GA4. A lot of people are not happy with this, and are jumping ship. We could capture a lot of new users.
  - If we build an analytics product that serves the needs of web marketers and integrates with the rest of our stack,
    we're well suited for a lot of new growth.

- Steps:
  - Figure out why are 80% of our B2B customers not using us for their marketing website?
    Is it missing features? Cost? Perception? Something else?
  - What are the needs of typical marketing websites and marketers? A guess: better ad and source tracking.
    Which of these are reasonable to build on our platform?
  - Do we want to move into this segment, or should we avoid it? Is it a distraction from our mission of helping people
    build better products? Might this result in a lot of low volume low quality free users?
  - Actually implement what comes out of this analysis

This objective includes a lot of product work to figure out what needs to be done. Thus it's the second objective
of the quarter. The idea is to give product and design enough time to get ahead of the engineers, who will start with
objective 1.
