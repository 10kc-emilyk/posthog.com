In PostHog, as a company of [product-minded engineers](/blog/turning-engineers-into-product-people), we believe if you're 
not having a good experience with our product, we're not doing a good job. No matter if it's because we don't have the 
features you need, or the existing features do not spark enough joy.

Thus, the multifunctional team **responsible for the overall quality, feature set and user experience of PostHog's app** 
is not called "Team App", but "Team Core Experience".

Obviously one team can't do all of this alone. PostHog consists of multiple small teams who are specialised in various
slices of the app, such as [Team Core Analytics](/handbook/people/team-structure/core-analytics) (analytic queries at scale), 
[Team Growth](/handbook/people/team-structure/growth-engineering) (experimentation, activation), and 
[Team Platform](/handbook/people/team-structure/platform) (plugins, deployments). 

In addition to working on features ourselves, Team Core Experience provides technical alignment to the rest of the 
organization in matters of product design, user experience, and frontend & API tooling.

## People

[See team structure page](/handbook/people/team-structure/team-structure)


## Mission

Company goal that resonates most with this team:

> Quality: Our core features (insights, recordings, feature-flags / experimentation) work like a Swiss watch.

Team Core Experience aims to:

- Increase the quality of our features across all dimensions (see scope below).
- Maintain a coherent strategy for frontend and API development (technologies, tools and methodology).
- Ensuring our features are used the way we expect them to.
- Understanding users and their needs... and solving for that.

## Goals

What is quality and how do we track it?

We track specific goals/targets depending on feature. For example:

- Qualitative data (what users are saying)
- Measured data (KPIs, performance metrics, etc)
- Internal company feedback (meeting company goals)

Main metric: number of discoveries.

## Scope

We handle everything not owned by Core Analytics and Platform.

We handle everything people in the team have worked on.

What are the things that we're uniquely best at doing?
- Frontend
- Product
- 


## How we work

- How we work: What processes and behaviors we expect to get stuff done?
- Document things!
