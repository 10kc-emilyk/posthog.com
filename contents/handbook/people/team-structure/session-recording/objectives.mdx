- Objectives: Start charging for session recordings resulting in a $100K increase in ARR from $0 today.
- Key results
    - Build flow and upsells for getting people to use and pay for session recording
    - Mobile session recording mvp
        - Why? Currently, we don’t have any ability to track mobile session recording and have obvious debugging gaps in the product. These both come up frequently on customer calls.
        - Ben: Proof of concept, use the product people to figure out how much it solves. People won’t pay for this this Q, so doesn’t help this objective.
    - Network/DOM/debugging type use case/alerts
        - Why?
            - Demonstrating we can upsell other products means we no longer need customers to send more than 1m events/month to charge them, so we can grow faster.
            - Whatever we learn here, we will apply to feature flags / any other major feature we build. We don’t want to do several at once like this.
