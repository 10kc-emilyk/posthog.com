subtitle: Long live the product engineer
alt subtitle: Radical transperency is the only path

The goal of a product manager should be to not exist...

...

Okay that's a bit extreme. The real goal should be to not need to tell your engineers what to build.

Because this is the fastest way to build products.

If your engineers decide what to build it means you:

- have fewer meetings
- have less process
- retain and attract the best engineers
- build the best product

But how do you get there? In this post we dive into xyz.

## The current role of a product manager

In most companies, a product manager's two main jobs are to align people and determine the product roadmap. The need for this approach is a symptom of two causes:

- lack of transparency
- poor context setting / not providing enough information for engineers to be autonomous


The implication of that this appraoch is about controlling, and are the reason why it's hard for engineers to decide what to build themselves. So let's focus on we can do to fix this.


Good quote: Implication: It’s not about controlling, it’s about enabling. If PMs are spending too much time on project management, your org needs a rethink. 🤔

### Transparency

<a hedgehog made of glass. Another hedgehog saying "I can see everything!"

If you want to move fast, transparency is the only way. It builds trust, cuts politics and speeds up decision making. The more you share, the better.

But most companies don't lean towards it. Why?

To learn how to fix this, let's look at the most common reasons why companies don't share openly

- The thought never occured to them to be transparent
- They're worried employees might react negatively if they see bad news
- They're hiding something (not common)
- They dont trust their team.
- (other reasons?)

But these are mistakes (list reason why)


Pro Tip: Make it hard not to share. Transparency is the best cure for hidden agendas. 💪
**Actionable tip: Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.**

Trust. If you can’t trust your team, what are you doing?

How to build transparency

Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.

Something on: Write. everything. down. Why? It's faster, it's always there, and it;s clearer (source: https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/habits-of-effective-remote-teams)


Communication hierarchy:

PRs > issues > public slack channels > DMs > email > fax > tapping someone on the shoulder and saying "hey, you got a minute?"
(maybe make this into a graphic)


Reminder: communication quality still matters

#### Other notes on transparency

Share you strategy and progress against it:
mission
company metrics + board meeting slides and notes

i) We make clear what we're trying to achieve.
To do this, we have a clear, simple mission and strategy. We communicate this repeatedly through our public handbook, during everyone's onboarding, repeatedly in our all hands, and when we plan each quarter of work.

maybe something on how we're transparent when people let go for perofmrnace reason


One more thing:
you can share almost all this stuff publicly

ii) We share all our metrics
We constantly update everyone on our progress towards these goals (for each product and in total), financial information, fundraising progress (before, during and after it happens), and pretty much anything else people ask for.


PostHog eliminated 1:1s almost entirely because they’re a breeding ground for silos and politics. Instead, they stick to three core communication channels:
All-Hands for company-wide updates. Slack for real-time communication.
GitHub for tracking development. The goal is to minimize distraction and keep engineers in building mode. 🏗️


### Fix #2: Better context setting

Product Managers provide the context (SQL, research, user data), track results, and reduce blockers.


Actionable tip: If you're engineer, start speaking to your users.



## How to increase autonomy? / Better context setting

When deciding what to build,Engineers should be drivers, not the passengers. What does this mean for a PM and their role?

This means the PMs job is actually:
- create all the input needed for decisions (context / SQL / research* (but not user interviews right?))
- track the output (growth reviews)


Engineers decide what to build. Implications for execs:
- trust (if you can't trust your team, what are you doing?)
- communication instead of prioritization


good quote: “Hire smart people who can thrive with autonomy, then get out of their way


#### Remove the information Information bottleneck
We have a simple theory about building successful products: the people building them should be as close to people using them as possible.

You might think you already know what users want. Someone spoke to users, turned those insights into tickets, and it's on you to build them. That’s all you need.

The process probably looks something like this:
https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa61c95bd-04e1-4f03-9388-750f760cc377_1251x665.png
source: https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/talk-to-users

Engineers in this scenario get a sanitized version of the truth. They miss out on the context and depth users can provide, and they’re subject to the preferences and biases of the person doing the talking.

Worse still, often that person won’t understand the options and constraints as well as you do. Sometimes, only an engineer can understand the full context of a problem and ask the right questions to find a good solution.

Not convinced? Think of user interviews like automated tests. Like automated tests, talking to users is a short-term investment in your long-term productivity. They both enable you to iterate faster by providing rapid feedback on whether what you've built is working, even if you’re not shipping code.

# Hire people that thrive with autonomy:

more / broader experience
‘engineers’ -> ‘product engineers’
decide what to build
ship
iterate

Have a structure that promotes it - small teams with minimal dependencies. (large teams = more meetings, more process, more communication overhead, more alignment, more bureaucracy, more politics, more bullshit)

Why does this matter? Just look at this screenshot of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog:

They:
- Own their pricing.
- Make their own product decisions.
- Have access to the revenue, hosting, and staff costs for their product.
- Are responsible for coordinating with our marketing and growth teams.

**!!! You gain more information by doing than planning/aligning.So the faster you can ship, the better the product you can build.**

⚡ 3. 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐦𝐲 > 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬
James’s view is simple: Choose trust or process. Never both.
At PostHog, engineers are more than just coders; they’re Product Engineers, often ex-founders and technical leads who want autonomy. 💻


# Other notes 

## 2. Product engineers > Product managers
The responsibilities of a product manager still exist, but our engineers:

Talk to users.

Decide what to build within their product.

Often pitch or build entirely new products to extend the platform.

## The path to an autonomous engineering team

- what an autonomus team is. Why they're awesome
  - You gain more information by doing than planning/aligning.
  - So the faster you can ship, the better the product you can build.
  - If your engineers decide what to build it means you:

- have fewer meetings
- have less process
- retain and attract the best engineers
- build the best product



What stopping teams from being autonomou
- Not enough information
- Not enough context
- Not enough trust

## not enough information


## Not enough context


## Not enough trust
Symptom of this is too much process. You end up needing a product manager to manage all these processes, so that the engineering team is unblocked


# How to create autonomous engineering teams:

## Intro

In startups, speed is everything. 

The faster you ship things, the more information you produce, which means the better, the better the product you can build, which gives you the best chance of winning

By how do you move fast? You empower your builders and get out of their way.

It sounds obvious, but yet almost every company puts things in their way. Alignment, process, meetings, PMs, etc. Yet you gain more information by doing than by planning or aligning.

![Things in the way of an engineering team](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/pm_approva_c1ad9be668.png)

In this post we dive into how to get out of the way of your builders and build truly autonomous engineering teams.

## 1. Start small

The first step in creating autonomous teams is to have a structure that promotes. In practice, this means [small teams](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/the-magic-of-small-engineering-teams). 

Why? Because large teams = more meetings, more process, more alignment, more politics, and more bullshit. And more bullshit means less building 💩

Why does this matter? We use small teams at PostHog, and just look at this screenshot of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog:
<graphic of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog>

A small team is a team that:

- has less than six people
- decides on it's own processes (or lack thereof)
- has one leader (to minimize layers of management)

What a small team does is:
- Decide their own goals
- Prioritizing their roadmap
- Talk to their customers

A small team can consist of many different roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, and support.

something something...

This brings us to the next point...

## 2. Refactor the product manager

The goal of a product manager should be to not exist...

![A magician hog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/magician_hog_a1934d0b3a.png)

Okay that's a bit extreme. But the real goal of a PM should be to not tell your engineers what to build, because this is the fastest way to build products.

If your engineers decide what to build it means you:

- have fewer meetings
- have less process
- retain and attract the best engineers
- and ultimately build the best product

But why dont engineer decide what to build? In most companies, a product manager's two main jobs are to align people and determine the product roadmap. While this sounds good in theory, in reality they become gatekeepers of information. And when you become the gatekeeper of information, you become the decision maker

## 4. Communicate like your life depends on it

You still need to be a good communicator
What does good communication look like?

## 5. Maybe.. how to align teams?

## 5. Maybe... hiring?
Hire people that thrive with autonomy:

more / broader experience
‘engineers’ -> ‘product engineers’
decide what to build
ship
iterate

How do you do this?
