# How to create autonomous engineering teams

In startups, speed is everything. 

The faster you ship things, the more information you produce, which means the better, the better the product you can build, which gives you the best chance of winning

By how do you move fast? You empower your builders and get out of their way.

It sounds obvious, but yet almost every company puts things in their way. Alignment, process, meetings, PMs, etc. Yet you gain more information by doing than by planning or aligning.

![Things in the way of an engineering team](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/pm_approva_c1ad9be668.png)

In this post we dive into how to get out of the way of your builders and build truly autonomous engineering teams.

## 1. Start small

The first step in creating autonomous teams is to have a structure that promotes. In practice, this means [small teams](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/the-magic-of-small-engineering-teams). 

Why? Because large teams = more meetings, more process, more alignment, more politics, and more bullshit. And more bullshit means less building üí©

With small team, you have less people to convince
Why does this matter? We use small teams at PostHog, and just look at this screenshot of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog:
<graphic of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog>

A small team is a team that:

- has less than six people
- decides on it's own processes (or lack thereof)
- has one leader (to minimize layers of management)

What a small team does is:
- Decide their own goals
- Prioritizing their roadmap
- Talk to their customers

A small team can consist of many different roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, and support.

something something...

This brings us to the next point...


?- Own their pricing.
- Make their own product decisions.
- Have access to the revenue, hosting, and staff costs for their product.
- Are responsible for coordinating with our marketing and growth teams.

## 2. Let engineers decide what to build

If your engineers decide what to build it means you: (need to elaborate on this)

- need fewer meetings
- need less process
- retain and attract the best engineers
- and ultimately build the best product

This sounds good in theory, but in practice it's hard to do. Why? In most companies, engineers suffer from two handicaps:

(maybe this needs to be one point)
- Poor context setting. Engineers don't have enough information to make the right decisions.
- Lack of transparency in company. Engineers don't know what's going on.

Then, instead of addressing these to empower engineers and giving them more information, they outsource the problem to product managers to deal with this. PMs do x and y. In this scenario, engineers get a sanitized version of the truth. They miss out on the context and depth users can provide, and they‚Äôre subject to the preferences and biases of the person doing the talking. Plus they get annoying at product managers.

The thought goes "let's not bother our engineers with this unimportant stuff. Let's give them more time to code". While in the right place, this is mistake
 They become the gatekeepers of truth and decide what to build

![Star wars meme 2](https://imgflip.com/i/99blkh)
![Star wars meme build better products](https://imgflip.com/i/99bm06)

Instead, we offer two solutions.

And instead of fixing address these issues and empowering engineers, most companies give the PMs more work. Instead of empowering engineers, their job becomes aligning people and determine the product roadmap.


### Solution 1: Refactor the PM job

The goal of a product manager should be to not exist...

// maybe take this meme out?
![A magician hog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/magician_hog_a1934d0b3a.png)

Okay that's a bit extreme. But the real goal of a PM should be to empower your engineers, not control them. A tell-tale sign your product managers are controlling your engineers is that they're spending more time on project management than anything else.

Then, instead of addressing these to empower engineers and giving them more information, they give them _less_. The product managers role becomes aligning people, gathering information, and determining the product roadmap. While this sounds good in theory, in reality they become gatekeepers of information. And when you become the gatekeeper of information, you become the decision maker.

![Bilbo meme](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/98nrsd_0ed5d1556f.jpg)

PM job should be: How can I give the engineers all the information they need to decide what to build? Not, how can I tell them what to build. They should do this by:

1. They create all the input needed to make informed decisions and give these to the engineers ‚Äì e.g. data insights, competitor research, user research. Whats going on in the wider market. What are the competitor features we need to be aware of. Identify opportunites for the team (e.g. ltos of churn now, here's the data. How can we fix) etc.. Stop giving them tickets, FFS.
2. Dont outsource everything though. Engineers should still [talk to users](), and xyz.
3. Course correction. They track the output so you know if the team is on the right track. If not, present the findings to yoru team and let your engineers decide what to do next.

Why?
Something along the lines of enabling insteaf of controlling?
This empowers team to make the right decisions and reduces filtering. 

### Solution 2: Become radically transparent

// MAYBE REMOVE THIS SECTION?

james says: core this is trust. Signal yo udont have trust is you have process

things you can share:

- exec sprint notes:
  - What execs are up to, what they talked about, what was teh conclusion
- P&L

<a hedgehog made of glass. Another hedgehog saying "I can see everything!". Board in blackboard behind hedgehog reads "MASTER PLAN">
< a hedgehog made of glass doing tricks on a skateboard. Someone else saying "Radical!">

The second part of letting your engineers decide is to let them know whats going on and the companies prioerities.

We've already mentioned how transparency helps gives engineers information to make the right product decisions. But it also builds trust,  speed up decision making, and cut politics (you can't stab someone in the back if they know everything you're doing).




Communicate everything in public. _Everything_.


But most companies don't lean towards it. Why?

- The thought never occured to them to be transparent.
  - This is the most common reason.
- They're worried employees might react negatively if they see bad news
- They're hiding something (not common)
  - Hopefully its not this 
- They dont trust their team.
  - Seriously. If you can't trust your team, what are you doing?
- (other reasons?)

But these are mistakes (list reason why)

What shouldnt you communicate in public?


Pro Tip: Make it hard not to share. Transparency is the best cure for hidden agendas. üí™
**Actionable tip: Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.**

How to build transparency

Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.


maybe have a seciton

Why dont companies do this? Process.

why is this important?

How to do it?

Communication hierarchy:

<graphic of PRs > issues > public slack channels > DMs > email > fax > tapping someone on the shoulder and saying "hey, you got a minute?">

Reminder: communication quality still matters

DMs are problematic. No visibility.
Also introduces politics. 

<somewhere in this blog include screenshot of Cory telling everyone to post publicly>

The most important we've ever built at PostHog comes from letting engineers decide what to build. 
- Session replay
  - James: I think this is a terrible idea. We should have one product and have that at 100 millions of dollars in revenue before we build another product
  - Engineer: Well, heres a bunch of users that are asking, and I think I could build this in a week
  - James: I think this is a bad idea, but on principle, I'll let you build it.
  - He built, widely popular, and second biggest product in terms of revenue
  - Then this unlocked our thought of "What about the other 10 or 50 products we could build". Changed entire posthog strategy. So we built a/b testing, features flags, surveys, and planning to build more
  - And this all came from a single engineer disagreeing with the CEO!
- HogQL

 
### What can you do as exec?

At an exec level, we sharing finance, funding. Nice for people to know. Sets the tone for the company. Builds trust.
profit and loss
revenue etc.

Can see team costs, infrastructure costs, etc.

We do it so encourages the team to share what theyre doing.

We also share pay structure, hiring/not hiring/firing (for performance reasons. Strong performers rally around this and dont want people who arent shipping or getting their job odne), vacations, personal readmes

PostHog eliminated 1:1s almost entirely because they‚Äôre a breeding ground for silos and politics. Instead, they stick to three core communication channels:
All-Hands for company-wide updates. Slack for real-time communication.
GitHub for tracking development. The goal is to minimize distraction and keep engineers in building mode. üèóÔ∏è

### ..something on trust?

If you can't trust your team to make decisions, what are you doing?
When companies have a lack of trust, they add a ton of process. 
most companies default to this
Needs come top down. Im hiring people taht are good enough to make decisions.

Symptom of this is too much process. You end up needing a product manager to manage all these processes, so that the engineering team is unblocked

"Im an idiot. My team are smart. I should listen to them."

James‚Äôs view is simple: Choose trust or process. Never both.

## 4.Trust your engineers..

All this requires a high level of trust in your engineers and their competency. Easier said than done. How do you do this?

BUt how to do this? Easier said than done.

## 4. Goal planning

@ 16:45

We used to do classic OKRs, output based metrics like increase activation,
We started doing this. This is too difficult for engineer to set. We used to have increased retention

We delibrately dont call it OKRs. We call it goals, which are things you are going to ship
We have metings to validate assumptions. This is 

your goals are literally a things youre going to build
 I will make assumption with you that these are correct
 and if over the quarter we see activation or retention gets worse. We change them.

 Doesnt create existential dread on improving single metric. Instead they can focus on building the thing?

 Sprint planning default. Async meetings. How last week went, how next week going to be. Gives a high level overview of the pulse of the team

 We do "growth reviews" where we go through all the metrics. Once a month. PM puts it together. Engineering that leads the team joins. 
 Then we assess if you build it

 Every piece of feedback is led. Brand mentions, churn survey,

## 4. The right tooling for the job

<Hedgehog thanos meme with infitinity stones. Each stone represents a different tool e.g no meetings, >

Most human beings arent as magical as product as steve jobs. They dont just "know" what to build or have a grand vision.

You learn more by shipping things and getting in the hands of users than by planning. So the faster you can ship, the better the product you can build.

Derisk shipping things. If you ship a feature directly to all your features, things could go horribly wrong. E.g. ship to a million users, could have scaling users, users could hate it, could break things.

So the way we release software is designed to let this happen.

We ship feature behind feature flags. First to hanful of friendly users, then let users opt in, then launch to everyone in beta, then 10% of users, then everyone

or "process". 
The difference here is that this process is _enabling_, not controlling. It gives engineers more autonomy, not less.
Good quote: Implication: It‚Äôs not about controlling, it‚Äôs about enabling. If PMs are spending too much time on project management, your org needs a rethink. ü§î

Maybe add HogQL story here

## No design by default

You remove blocker, dependency on designer. To be clear we stil have designers. Engineers can go away and design their own stuff.
They can go talk to product designer and ak for help like "hey, im struggling with the UX of this thing, or Im getting "

The engineer is the driver of the car! not the passenger
(hedhgehogs in a car, driver is an engineer. Product manager is in the backseat. Designer in the back too. Another engineer in the front seat)

Reminder: communication quality still matters

<somewhere in this blog include screenshot of Cory telling everyone to post publicly>

## 4. Maybe Speak to your users?

<graphic on information bottleneck>
![Information bottleneck](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/v1713894881/posthog.com/contents/images/newsletter/talk-to-users/bottleneck3.png)


Actionable tip: If you're engineer, start speaking to your users.

We have a simple theory about building successful products: the people building them should be as close to people using them as possible.

You might think you already know what users want. Someone spoke to users, turned those insights into tickets, and it's on you to build them. That‚Äôs all you need.

The process probably looks something like this:
https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa61c95bd-04e1-4f03-9388-750f760cc377_1251x665.png
source: https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/talk-to-users

Engineers in this scenario get a sanitized version of the truth. They miss out on the context and depth users can provide, and they‚Äôre subject to the preferences and biases of the person doing the talking.

Worse still, often that person won‚Äôt understand the options and constraints as well as you do. Sometimes, only an engineer can understand the full context of a problem and ask the right questions to find a good solution.

Not convinced? Think of user interviews like automated tests. Like automated tests, talking to users is a short-term investment in your long-term productivity. They both enable you to iterate faster by providing rapid feedback on whether what you've built is working, even if you‚Äôre not shipping code.

#### Other notes on transparency

Share you strategy and progress against it:
mission
company metrics + board meeting slides and notes

i) We make clear what we're trying to achieve.
To do this, we have a clear, simple mission and strategy. We communicate this repeatedly through our public handbook, during everyone's onboarding, repeatedly in our all hands, and when we plan each quarter of work.

From https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/how-to-design-your-company-for-speed 


On product:
quarterly goals
every team‚Äôs planning sessions
sprint plans
every metric (revenue/usage/support)
every piece of feedback


remove the politics by sharing the following: 

On finance/fundraising:
before - philosophy
during - how it‚Äôs going
after - everyone does this
p&l / revenue etc

On people:
pay structure
hiring/not hiring/firing
vacations
personal readmes


maybe something on how we're transparent when people let go for perofmrnace reason


One more thing:
you can share almost all this stuff publicly

ii) We share all our metrics
We constantly update everyone on our progress towards these goals (for each product and in total), financial information, fundraising progress (before, during and after it happens), and pretty much anything else people ask for.

## 4. Communicate like your life depends on it

You still need to be a good communicator
What does good communication look like?

## 5. Maybe.. how to align teams?

## 5. Maybe... hiring?
Hire people that thrive with autonomy:

more / broader experience
‚Äòengineers‚Äô -> ‚Äòproduct engineers‚Äô
decide what to build
ship
iterate

How do you do this?

good quote: ‚ÄúHire smart people who can thrive with autonomy, then get out of their way





## TODO:
- More research on how to create autonomous engineering teams 
- Have I just ended up back at Small Teams newsletter??? Reread it 

---


## 1. Radical transparency / share everything
## 2. Trust over control/process 
## 3. Small teams


## 4. Refactor the product manager
## 5. Communicate like your life depends on it

Maybe something on async here
