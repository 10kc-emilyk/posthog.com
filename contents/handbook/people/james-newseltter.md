# How to create autonomous engineering teams

In startups, speed is everything. 

The faster you ship things, the more information you produce, which means the better, the better the product you can build, which gives you the best chance of winning

By how do you move fast? You empower your builders and get out of their way.

It sounds obvious, but yet almost every company puts things in their way. Alignment, process, meetings, PMs, etc. Yet you gain more information by doing than by planning or aligning.

In this post we dive into how to get out of the way of your builders and build truly autonomous engineering teams.

## 1. Start small

The first step in creating autonomous teams is to have a structure that promotes. In practice, this means [small teams](https://newsletter.posthog.com/p/the-magic-of-small-engineering-teams). 

Why? Because large teams = more meetings, more process, more alignment, more politics, and more bullshit. And more bullshit means less building 💩

With small team, you have less people to convince
Why does this matter? We use small teams at PostHog, and just look at this screenshot of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog:
<graphic of a typical week for an engineer at Posthog>

A small team is a team that:

- has less than six people
- decides on it's own processes (or lack thereof)
- has one leader (to minimize layers of management)

What a small team does is:
- Decide their own goals
- Prioritizing their roadmap
- Talk to their customers

A small team can consist of many different roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, and support.

This brings us to the next point...


?- Own their pricing.
- Make their own product decisions.
- Have access to the revenue, hosting, and staff costs for their product.
- Are responsible for coordinating with our marketing and growth teams.

## 2. Let engineers decide what to build

If your engineers decide what to build it means you: (need to elaborate on this)

- need fewer meetings
- need less process
- retain and attract the best engineers
- and ultimately build the best product

This sounds good in theory, but in practice it's hard to do. Why? In most companies, engineers suffer from two handicaps:

(maybe this needs to be one point)
- Poor context setting. Engineers don't have enough information to make the right decisions.
- Lack of transparency in company. Engineers don't know what's going on.

Then, instead of addressing these to empower engineers and giving them more information, they outsource the problem to product managers to deal with this. PMs do x and y. In this scenario, engineers get a sanitized version of the truth. They miss out on the context and depth users can provide, and they’re subject to the preferences and biases of the person doing the talking. Plus they get annoying at product managers.

The thought goes "let's not bother our engineers with this unimportant stuff. Let's give them more time to code". While in the right place, this is mistake
 They become the gatekeepers of truth and decide what to build

![Star wars meme build better products](https://imgflip.com/i/99bm06)

Instead, we offer two solutions.

And instead of fixing address these issues and empowering engineers, most companies give the PMs more work. Instead of empowering engineers, their job becomes aligning people and determine the product roadmap.


### Solution 1: Refactor the PM job

The goal of a product manager should be to not exist...

// maybe take this meme out?
![A magician hog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/magician_hog_a1934d0b3a.png)

Okay that's a bit extreme. But the real goal of a PM should be to empower your engineers, not control them. A tell-tale sign your product managers are controlling your engineers is that they're spending more time on project management than anything else.

Then, instead of addressing these to empower engineers and giving them more information, they give them _less_. The product managers role becomes aligning people, gathering information, and determining the product roadmap. While this sounds good in theory, in reality they become gatekeepers of information. And when you become the gatekeeper of information, you become the decision maker.

![Bilbo meme](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/98nrsd_0ed5d1556f.jpg)

PM job should be: How can I give the engineers all the information they need to decide what to build? Not, how can I tell them what to build. They should do this by:

1. They create all the input needed to make informed decisions and give these to the engineers – e.g. data insights, competitor research, user research. Whats going on in the wider market. What are the competitor features we need to be aware of. Identify opportunites for the team (e.g. ltos of churn now, here's the data. How can we fix) etc.. Stop giving them tickets, FFS.
2. Dont outsource everything though. Engineers should still [talk to users](), and xyz.
3. Course correction. They track the output so you know if the team is on the right track. If not, present the findings to yoru team and let your engineers decide what to do next. (more on how to do this exactly later)

Why?
Something along the lines of enabling insteaf of controlling?
This empowers team to make the right decisions and reduces filtering. 

### Solution 2: Become radically transparent

// MAYBE REMOVE THIS SECTION? But we should add a bit to it above

james says: core this is trust. Signal yo udont have trust is you have process

things you can share:

- exec sprint notes:
  - What execs are up to, what they talked about, what was teh conclusion
- P&L

<a hedgehog made of glass. Another hedgehog saying "I can see everything!". Board in blackboard behind hedgehog reads "MASTER PLAN">
< a hedgehog made of glass doing tricks on a skateboard. Someone else saying "Radical!">

The second part of letting your engineers decide is to let them know whats going on and the companies prioerities.

We've already mentioned how transparency helps gives engineers information to make the right product decisions. But it also builds trust,  speed up decision making, and cut politics (you can't stab someone in the back if they know everything you're doing).




Communicate everything in public. _Everything_.


But most companies don't lean towards it. Why?

- The thought never occured to them to be transparent.
  - This is the most common reason.
- They're worried employees might react negatively if they see bad news
- They're hiding something (not common)
  - Hopefully its not this 
- They dont trust their team.
  - Seriously. If you can't trust your team, what are you doing?
- (other reasons?)

But these are mistakes (list reason why)

What shouldnt you communicate in public?


Pro Tip: Make it hard not to share. Transparency is the best cure for hidden agendas. 💪
**Actionable tip: Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.**

How to build transparency

Share everything by default. Make it hard to not share things.


maybe have a seciton

Why dont companies do this? Process.

why is this important?

Communication hierarchy:

Reminder: communication quality still matters

DMs are problematic. No visibility.
Also introduces politics. 

<somewhere in this blog include screenshot of Cory telling everyone to post publicly>

The most important we've ever built at PostHog comes from letting engineers decide what to build. 
- Session replay
  - James: I think this is a terrible idea. We should have one product and have that at 100 millions of dollars in revenue before we build another product
  - Engineer: Well, heres a bunch of users that are asking, and I think I could build this in a week
  - James: I think this is a bad idea, but on principle, I'll let you build it.
  - He built, widely popular, and second biggest product in terms of revenue
  - Then this unlocked our thought of "What about the other 10 or 50 products we could build". Changed entire posthog strategy. So we built a/b testing, features flags, surveys, and planning to build more
  - And this all came from a single engineer disagreeing with the CEO!
- HogQL

 
#### What can you do as exec?

At an exec level, we sharing finance, funding. Nice for people to know. Sets the tone for the company. Builds trust.
profit and loss
revenue etc.

Can see team costs, infrastructure costs, etc.

We do it so encourages the team to share what theyre doing.

We also share pay structure, hiring/not hiring/firing (for performance reasons. Strong performers rally around this and dont want people who arent shipping or getting their job odne), vacations, personal readmes

PostHog eliminated 1:1s almost entirely because they’re a breeding ground for silos and politics. Instead, they stick to three core communication channels:
All-Hands for company-wide updates. Slack for real-time communication.
GitHub for tracking development. The goal is to minimize distraction and keep engineers in building mode. 🏗️

### ..something on trust?


## 4.Trust your engineers

Letting your engineers decide what to build requires a high level of trust. This is easier said than done, since you don't want to blindly give them control and expect them to make good decisions. 

Most companies try to do this by adding more checks and processes. But this is a anti-pattern. You slow the team down and the team ends up with less autonomy, not more. And then you end up needing a product manager to manage all these processes. Lots of process is a sign of low trust, not high.

![Things in the way of an engineering team](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmukukwp6/image/upload/pm_approva_c1ad9be668.png)

So how do you do this?

Two things you need to do:
- Effective goal planning
- Growth reviews

### 1. Plan the goals together, but let the engineers drive

(hedhgehogs in a car, driver is an engineer. Product manager and CEO are in the backseat. Another engineer in the front seat)
<alt: [get in loser memee](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/c5/d2/97c5d2bad1db9d03bb450ccffb08c9ea.jpg) with hedgehogs. engineers in front, PM in the back) "Get in loser, we're going planning")

We used to do OKRs and metric-based goals at goals. But we ran into two problems with it:

1. Engineers found it difficult to determine what's the right metric to focus on.
2. Engineers ended up focusing too much on moving the metric and small quick wins, rather than actually building what our users wanted.
3. ....

So we abandoned it. Instead, the outcome of our planning sessions a list of things the team is going build. We deliberately don't call it OKRs because we don't want to imply that we expect them to be output-based.

Our quarterly planning goes something like this:

1. Execs talk through the company's goals and what we're trying to achieve. For example, "we need to increase top of funnel adoption", or "we want to become an all-in-one tool, so we need to build more products", " we need to increase retention".
2. Driven by the engineers, The engineers discuss and decide what they need to build to achieve this, if needed, they get advice/guidance from the execs as needed/requested. As an exec, I make an assumption that these are correct.
3. The meeting ends with a list of what the team is going to build.

This works because everyone is clear what the team is going to build. The engineers don't need to needlessly fret about a specific metric, we already decided _together_ what we're going to do. and they're more excited to build since they're the ones who decided on their work. So all they need to focus on is working through their list.

But how do you actually track if what you're doing is working? Enter the growth review:

### 2. Do a monthly growth review

Now that you've decided what to build, the you need to review that htings are actually going well. The purpose of this to review the products or features that the team is responsbile for. The purpose of this meeting is for the team to check and see if they're on the right track.

We run these meetings with the engineering team lead, PM, and CEO.

It's the PMs job to make you sure have all the information you need. Gather any information on the teams output.
First, gather any signal you may have on this (usually collected by the product manager). We find the following signals useful:

- Revenue metrics: MRR, month-on-month growth, revenue churn rate, total paying customers count
- Usage metrics: Active users, user growth rate, orginization growth rate (if B2B), user retention rate
- User feedback: NPS score, customer interviews, support tickets, any other requests.

This is essentially the output of the team's work
We review this information together in the meeting. Then, it's up to the engineering team lead to decide how they think the teams doing, and, if given the data, whether anything needs to be done about. For example, they could decide that some recent user feedback is concerning and we're heading in the wrong direciton. In this case we can abandon the goals from the planning and change course. ALternatively, they can reprioritze, or decide that the team is on the right track and do nothing.

<wonder if need an example here> 

## 4. The right tooling for the job

<Hedgehog thanos meme with infitinity stones. Each stone represents a different tool e.g no meetings, biweekly 1-1s, no design by default, feature flag rollouts, transparent communication >

Now that we've covered the high-level strategy, here are tactical tips to help your engineering team move fast and build the best product

### 1. Communicate publicly :

### 2. feature flag rollouts

Most human beings arent as magical as product as steve jobs. They dont just "know" what to build or have a grand vision.

You learn more by shipping things and getting in the hands of users than by planning. So the faster you can ship, the better the product you can build.

Derisk shipping things. If you ship a feature directly to all your features, things could go horribly wrong. E.g. ship to a million users, could have scaling users, users could hate it, could break things.

So the way we release software is designed to let this happen.

We ship feature behind feature flags. First to hanful of friendly users, then let users opt in, then launch to everyone in beta, then 10% of users, then everyone

or "process". 
The difference here is that this process is _enabling_, not controlling. It gives engineers more autonomy, not less.
Good quote: Implication: It’s not about controlling, it’s about enabling. If PMs are spending too much time on project management, your org needs a rethink. 🤔

Maybe add HogQL story here

### 3. No design by default

You remove blocker, dependency on designer. To be clear we stil have designers. Engineers can go away and design their own stuff.
They can go talk to product designer and ak for help like "hey, im struggling with the UX of this thing, or Im getting "

The engineer is the driver of the car! not the passenger
(hedhgehogs in a car, driver is an engineer. Product manager is in the backseat. Designer in the back too. Another engineer in the front seat)

Reminder: communication quality still matters
