# Reference customers

When we initially developed PostHog's [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://posthog.com/handbook/who-we-are-building-for#our-current-icp), our aim was to [identify five reference customers](https://posthog.com/founders/creating-ideal-customer-profile). This goal was important to better understand our target users, their needs, and to assess if people were willing to pay to use PostHog.

If you're developing a new product at PostHog, we recommend setting a similar approach: Aim to acquire five reference customers for your product. Typically, this would happen after your product exits the Beta phase and becomes paid-for. From what we've seen, getting five reference customers on board is a pretty solid sign that you have found product-market fit and are starting to grow in terms of users and revenue.

## You know you have found a reference customer if:

- [ ]  They are using your product a lot
- [ ]  They tell you they’re delighted
- [ ]  They are paying a reasonable amount for the product
- [ ]  They fit PostHog’s Ideal Customer Profile
- [ ]  They are not using your product for a non-standard use case

## Here are some tips to get started:

1. Chat with your early users. Ask them what they like and what's missing in your product.
2. In your small team standup, go over what potential reference customers are saying. Pick the most important stuff to work on.
3. After you add a new feature that users wanted, check back with them. See if they're actually using it and if it's what they needed.
4. Really focus on finding those key customers. If you look for them half-heartedly, it's not going to work. If you can’t find any, ask yourself why, and if any of your original hypotheses around ICP users or the product itself were wrong.
