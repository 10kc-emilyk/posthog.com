Product development at PostHog does not follow most conventions. Engineers decide what to work on mostly based on [high-level company goals](/handbook/strategy/strategy#direction-for-2022) and tactical roadmaps (example [App Team roadmap](/handbook/people/team-structure/team-app#roadmap)) that each team designs. However, we usually also incorporate some larger milestones which require multiple sprints to complete.

A milestone is usually a larger-scale "project" with a specific goal. It may encompass multiple [small teams](/handbook/people/team-structure/team-structure#small-teams) and spans a longer time period (in the past ~2-4 months). A milestone has a flexible timeframe and flexible scope. What we care about is accomplishing the goal, and we often discover better ways to achieve that goal while actively working on the milestone. General context (e.g. user context, goals, rationale, ...) for milestones is usually shared by the [Product Team](/handbook/product/product-team) while the scope, executional strategy and solution is defined by the Engineering Team.

One of our core values at PostHog is [We are open source](/handbook/company/values#we-are-open-source) and as such we want to share context on past milstones and their results.

## Diagnosing causes
* üïï Approximate dates: Aug 2021 - Feb 2022
* üéØ Goal: Obtain ball-park accurate and actionable hypotheses on why users dropped off.
* üîê Internal RFCs: [Original RFC](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/107), [success metrics](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/blob/main/requests-for-comments/2021-10-11-diagnosing-causes-success.md), [sprint themes](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/127).

### Context

Nailing funnels means people will find problems with their products, next we need to enable them to Diagnose Causes so they can fix these problems and make their product successful.


### Success metrics

TBD.


### Results

TBD.




## Nail funnels
* üïï Approximate dates: Jun 15, 2021 - Aug 6, 2021
* üéØ Goal: To get 5 reference customers in the controlled data / growth product segment we need to nail funnels.
* üîê Internal RFCs: [product-internal#84](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/84) & [product-internal#125](https://github.com/PostHog/product-internal/issues/125).

### Context

In order to achieve product market fit with this segment we need to start by solving a limited number of problems exceptionally well for a small number of customers (5) and then expand. For these 5 customers, in the Enterprise segment we aim to: "Our customers deeply understand their activation funnel to grow their product". The focus on the activation funnel is because this is one of the biggest problems that Enterprise customers experience.


### Results
Coming soon.
