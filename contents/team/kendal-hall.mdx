Hi, I'm Kendal. I have a degree in Law, and I thought I was going to use it to save the world! However I soon realised that it wasn't for me, so once I was finished I came home to Cambridge, and that is how I got into Executive assistance.

I currently live in Cambridge with my fiance and cat (Olly and Meatloaf- you can figure out who is who!) and outside of work I enjoy Formula 1, movies, crochet, and true crime.
