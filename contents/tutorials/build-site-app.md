Site apps make it quick and easy to add features like forms and banners to your site through our JavaScript library. This enables you to do things like capture feedback, add notifications, provide support, and more. These apps can then capture data for analysis in PostHog.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll teach you how to build a site app. To complete this tutorial, you only need¬†[Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to build and run the app.

## Basic setup

First, create a folder and add two files that make up our app `site.ts` and `plugin.json`.

```bash
mkdir cool_app
cd cool_app
touch site.ts
touch plugin.json
```

In `site.ts`, add some basic code that logs a variable from our config file (`plugin.json`).

```js
// site.ts
export function inject({ config, posthog }) {
  console.log(config.message)
}
```

In `plugin.json`, add details about the app and that message variable.

```js
{
  "name": "Cool app",
  "config": [
    {
      "key": "message",
      "name": "Message",
      "type": "string",
      "default": "Howdy from the console!",
      "required": true,
      "site": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Once done that, in the same folder, run this command to start the app locally:

```bash
npx @posthog/app-dev-server
```

After running this, open `localhost:3040` to see the app in debug mode. When we open up our console, we‚Äôll see our configured message.

We can update the config file on the page to get a new message. In our case, we changed `‚ÄúHowdy from the console!‚Äù` to `‚ÄúI‚Äôm a newly updated message!‚Äù`.

This is the basics of what we need to set up and we can start adding more functionality, starting with showing a button on the page for users to click.

## Showing an HTML button component

Right now, our app doesn‚Äôt do much. We want it to be useful and help us get feedback from our users. To do this, we‚Äôll add a button users click to tell us we are doing a good job. We‚Äôll also set up PostHog to capture an event when they do this. To start making this a reality, we‚Äôll need to create the component with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

In the `site.ts` file, add a `style` constant that stores the CSS styling for our button. Next, write a function `createShadow` to inject a Shadow DOM we have full control over in the page (and doesn‚Äôt mess with the current page). Finally, write the logic for our `inject` function to create the button, add it to the Shadow DOM, and have a trigger our `console.log` message set in the config. Putting these three together gives us something like this:

```js
// site.ts

const style = `
  .button {
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 20px;
    right: 20px;
    color: black;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Inter", "Segoe UI", "Roboto", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
    text-align: left;
    width: 48px;
    height: 48px;
    border-radius: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 40px;
    font-size: 32px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    z-index: 999999;
  }
`

export function inject({ config, posthog }) {

  const shadow = createShadow(style)
  let buttonElement: HTMLButtonElement

  function sendMessage(): void {
    console.log(config.message)
  }

  buttonElement = Object.assign(document.createElement('button'), {
    className: 'button',
    innerText: 'üëç',
    onclick: sendMessage,
  })
  shadow.appendChild(buttonElement)
}

function createShadow(style?: string): ShadowRoot {
  const div = document.createElement('div')
  const shadow = div.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
  if (style) {
    const styleElement = Object.assign(document.createElement('style'), {
      innerText: style,
    })
    shadow.appendChild(styleElement)
  }
  document.body.appendChild(div)
  return shadow
}
```

If you set it up correctly, you‚Äôll see a button with a thumbs-up emoji in the bottom right. Clicking on it logs the message you configured to the console again.

## Connecting to PostHog

Next, we‚Äôll want to make sure to connect to PostHog so we record when we‚Äôre doing a good job. The `posthog` object is already an argument in our inject function, we just need to call capture. Add a `posthog.capture()` call to our `inject` function in `site.ts`.

```js
export function inject({ config, posthog }) {

  const shadow = createShadow(style)
  let buttonElement: HTMLButtonElement

  function sendMessage(): void {
    console.log(config.message)
    posthog.capture('message', { content: config.message }) // new
  }

  buttonElement = Object.assign(document.createElement('button'), {
    className: 'button',
    innerText: 'üëç',
    onclick: sendMessage,
  })
  shadow.appendChild(buttonElement)
}
```

Once added, we can test if it working by clicking the button on our `localhost` page. We‚Äôll see the event show up under ‚ÄúCaptured Events‚Äù on.

![Captured event](../images/tutorials/build-site-app/captured-event.png)

You now have a basic app to get feedback from users. From here, you can take the component where you like. You can provide more information, encourage different actions, or add more complex components. We built a few apps that can serve as inspiration:

- [Feedback app](https://github.com/PostHog/feedback-app), a form for gathering feedback from your users
- [Notification bar](https://github.com/PostHog/notification-bar-app), a customizable notification bar for your site
- [Pineapple mode](https://github.com/PostHog/pineapple-mode-app), a button that makes your page fill with pineapples when clicked

## Adding site apps to your site

Once you‚Äôve created an app, the final step is deploying it to your site. The first step to deploying a site app is configuring your `posthog-js` initialization to include `opt_in_site_apps: true` . It should look like this:

```js
posthog.init("<ph_project_api_key>", { 
    "api_host": "<ph_instance_address>",
    "opt_in_site_apps": true 
})
```

Next, if you have a self-hosted instance, you can add your app by pasting its GitHub, GitLab, or npm URL in the advanced tab in ‚ÄúBrowse Apps.‚Äù If it is private, make sure to include `?private_token=TOKEN` at the end of the URL. 

> **Note:** Adding custom or third-party apps isn‚Äôt available for Cloud instances.

If you have a cloud instance, you can search for available apps in ‚ÄúBrowse Apps‚Äù (feedback, notification bar, and pineapple mode are all available). You can also submit your app by [emailing your GitHub URL to hey@posthog.com](mailto:hey@posthog.com?subject=Submit%20Plugin%20to%20Repository&body=Plugin%20GitHub%20link%3A). Once you‚Äôve done that, we‚Äôll review and potentially add your site app to the app store for everyone to use.
