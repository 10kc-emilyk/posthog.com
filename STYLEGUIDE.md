# Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define unified standards and guidelines for contributors to the PostHog Docs. 

As a developer-focused product, PostHog depends on its documentation to provide a good experience to users who wish to use our product. Thus, it is important that our Documentation is complete, concise, and well-written.

Hence, this guide aims to provide some basic guidelines for those wishing to contribute to the Documentation.

## Guidelines

**Use the Oxford comma for lists** 

Example: Write "bananas, apples, and oranges", not "bananas, apples and oranges".

**Capitalize the names of tools, protocols, and technologies**

Example: Write "Redis server", not "redis server".

**Capitalize acronyms**

Example: Write "URLs", not "urls".

**Capitalize every word in a title (except for prepositions)**

Example: Write "Documentation Style Guide" instead of "Documentation style guide". 

"Style Guide **for** Documentation" is fine, however.

**Adhere to the style standards of each programming language**

In code snippets, you should follow the conventions of the language the code is written in.

Example: Use `camelCase` for JavaScript, and `snake_case` for Python variables names.

**Where there is a Call to Action, always provide a link**

When you write: "You can contact us to learn more", make sure to provide the reader with the means to do so immediately. This could be a link to another page or an email address, for example. 

Making sure readers always have immediate access to the next suggested step significantly enhances the reading experience. This way, a reader doesn't have to scour the website to find where the hell the link to the Slack group is.

**Use in-line code for everything that is found somewhere on the code**

Rule of thumb: If it has an underscore, put a backtick around it. 

Examples: `API_KEY`, `distinct_id`, `reset()`.

**Avoid repetition of terms**

Example: "We believe this because we believe that..."

**Avoid `mailto` links**

They're mostly annoying, not helpful.
