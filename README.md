# WIP: PostHog.com

This is the new company website / docs and handbook.

This is based on gatsby-markdown-starter, itself a boilerplate for markdown-based website (Documentation, Blog, etc.).  Based on [gatsby-default-starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Quick Start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Clone the repo then navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd posthog.com/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*
